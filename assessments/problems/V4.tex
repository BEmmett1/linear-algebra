\begin{problem}{V4}
Determine if the set of all lattice points, i.e. $\{(x,y)\ \big|\ \text{$x$ and $y$ are integers} \}$ is a subspace of $\IR^2$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
This set is closed under addition, but not under scalar multiplication so it is not a subspace.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{V4}
Determine if $\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 0 \\ z \end{bmatrix}\  \bigg|\ x,y,z \in \IR\right\}$  a subspace of $\IR^4$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
It is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, so it is a subspace.  Alternatively, it is the image of the linear transformation from $\IR^3 \rightarrow \IR^4$ given by $$\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 0 \\ z \end{bmatrix}.$$
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}{V4} 
Let $W$ be the set of all 2 by 2 matrices which are not invertible.  Determine if $W$ is a subspace of $M_{2,2}$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
$W$ is closed under scalar multiplication, but not under addition. 
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}{V4} Let $W$ be the set of all polynomials of even degree.  Determine if $W$ is a subspace of the vector space of all polynomials.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
$W$ is closed under scalar multiplication, but not under addition.  For example, $x-x^2$ and $x^2$ are both in $W$, but $(x-x^2)+(x^2)=x \notin W$.
\end{solution}
