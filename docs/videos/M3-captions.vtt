00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:06,973
In this video, we're going to learn how to determine if a matrix is invertible or not.

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:14,013
So to me, the right way to think about invertibility is to think about linear transformations.

3
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:18,973
So let's suppose we have a linear transformation. From, say,

4
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:24,913
R^m to R^n,

5
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:30,973
we can call it.

6
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:36,613
So we want to know if this linear transformation is invertible. So I want to know if we can

7
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:41,973
find a map going the other way, which if it exists, we would call it

8
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:46,973
T inverse that undoes what T does. So in other words,

9
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:51,973
if T sends a vector v from R^m to w in R^n then T

10
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:59,323
inverse is gonna take that w and send it right back to where it came from, namely v.

11
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:03,973
So if we want an inverse to exist, we need to know what's going to happen to every

12
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:09,973
element of R^n. So in other words, every element

13
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:15,973
of R^n has to be mapped to by something in R^m.

14
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:26,963
And if I rephrase what I've just said, we said that T has to be surjective.

15
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:31,973
So to have any hope of an inverse existing, I have to have somewhere to send everything

16
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:36,973
in R^n back to. So it had to be mapped to by something from

17
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:43,583
R^m by T. So

18
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:48,973
the other issue that could happen is I need to have somewhere to go back to. But

19
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:53,973
one thing that could go wrong is if I have choices of where to go back to. So if I have two things in R^m

20
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:58,973
that T maps to the same place, then I don't know where I'm going to send

21
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:03,973
the thing from  R^n back to. So what we need to happen

22
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:08,973
is T needs to send different vectors to different places. And what I've just said

23
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:18,973
there is that T has to be bijective.

24
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:24,973
So if we want a matrix to be invertible,

25
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:36,023
the corresponding linear transformation must be by bijective.

26
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:40,973
I want to make one quick note before we look at an example. So note that

27
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:45,973
when I say T has to be surjective, that tells us a little bit about m and

28
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:50,973
in particular it tells us that m has to be at least as big as

29
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:55,973
n. If the dimension of our domain isn't big enough, we won't be all to

30
00:02:55,973 --> 00:03:01,973
fill up all of the codomain. And we also know something

31
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:06,973
from T being injective. If m was bigger

32
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:11,973
than n, then we could not be injective. We would have to squish something down

33
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:16,973
to fit it inside of R^n. So we know if

34
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:21,973
we are surjective, n better be at least as big as m. And if we're injected, it can't

35
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:27,703
be any bigger. So for bijective, m and n

36
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:31,973
have to be the same. So in terms of matrices, the only matrices that have any hope

37
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:43,973
of being invertible are square matrices. So let's look at an example.

38
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:49,433
So if I don't write down a square matrix, this is gonna be very easy, so

39
00:03:49,433 --> 00:04:01,973
I'll write down a square matrix.

40
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:08,973
So here is a three by three matrix corresponding to a map from R^3 to R^3.

41
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:14,973
We want to know if it's invertible or not. So the question we're asking ourselves is,

42
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:19,973
is the corresponding linear transformation bijective?

43
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:29,343
Well, the way we answer that question is to look at the reduced row echelon form of A.

44
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:34,703
Which in this case, I type in a calculator.

45
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:40,973
It has produced.

46
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:45,973
The identity matrix. And so in particular, we have a pivot in every column,

47
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:50,973
so our map is injective and we have a pivot in every row, so our

48
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:59,973
map is surjective. So our linear map.

49
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:04,973
Is bijectivee. So our Matrix

50
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:17,453
A is invertible.

51
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:21,973
In the next video, we'll talk about how to actually find the inverse of a once we know that it's

52
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,966
invertible.
