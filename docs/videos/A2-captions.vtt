00:00:00,695 --> 00:00:08,815
In this video, we're going to see how to compute the image of a vector when we're given a linear transformation in terms of its standard matrix.

2
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:16,625
So here I have written down a linear transformation from R^4 to R^3 given by this inter matrix.

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:21,275
And we're going to compute T of three one negative one, negative one.

4
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:28,805
Now the key idea is to remember that the definition of the standard matrix is that the columns are given by the images of the standard basis vectors.

5
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:35,165
So that first column two one minus one. That's the image. That's what T does to the vector one zero zero zero.

6
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:38,675
And that second column, three zero one is when ti does to the vector.

7
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:48,815
Zero one zero zero. And so on and so forth. So all we have to do is take our vector three one minus one minus one to figure out what T does to it.

8
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:55,775
We'll just write it as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors and then take advantage of linearity.

9
00:00:55,775 --> 00:01:00,815
So this is three times our first standard basis vector.

10
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:09,815
Plus, the second standard basis vector, minus the third standard basis vector.

11
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:21,815
Minus the fourth standard basis vector. And now, because T is linear, it respects addition and respects scalar multiplication.

12
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:27,815
So this is three times T One zero zero zero.

13
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:39,815
Plus, T of the second standard basis vector. Minus the third standard basis vector.

14
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:51,815
And minus the fourth standard basis vector. Now, T of one zero zero zero.

15
00:01:51,815 --> 00:02:01,815
That's the first column of our standard matrix. So this is three times two one minus one two zero one zero zero.

16
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:07,815
That's T of our second standard basis vector. That's just the second column of our standard matrix.

17
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:21,815
So I have three zero one. We'll subtract off T of the third standard basis vector, so that's the third column of our standard matrix.

18
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:51,955
And similarly subtract off the fourth column of the standard matrix. Now we just do a little bit of arithmetic.
