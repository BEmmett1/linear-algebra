00:00:01,443 --> 00:00:06,723
In this video, we're going to discuss how to find a basis of the kernel

2
00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:11,603
of a linear transformation. So I have the same linear transformation we've been working with

3
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:16,603
T going from R^4 to R^3 given by Standard Matrix written down

4
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:22,603
there. But I also rewrote what T does to the vector x, y, z, w.

5
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:27,603
Right. So we could also see this as setting the vector X, Y, Z W to the vector

6
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:34,593
2x+4y+2z-4w in the first component and so on and so forth.

7
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:39,603
And we'll see why this is helpful in just a second. So just to recall from

8
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:44,883
previous, the kernel of a linear transformation is all the things that get mapped

9
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:50,073
to the zero vector. So the question we're asking ourselves is what vectors

10
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:55,623
X, Y, Z, W when we plug them into T, spit out the zero vector.

11
00:00:55,623 --> 00:01:00,663
So in other words, what we need to happen is we need to have that first component equal

12
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:07,723
to zero.

13
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:18,623
We need to have that second component equal to zero.

14
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:23,943
And this one was supposed to be zero. And

15
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:31,093
the third component needs to also be zero.

16
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:36,313
So in other words, we need to solve a homogenous system

17
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:41,413
of equations in order to find the kernel. And so

18
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:46,603
if we want to find a basis of the kernel, we are simply finding a basis of solution

19
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:53,713
set of a homogenous system of equations, which is exactly standard V9.

20
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:59,233
So let's finish this one out. We have written down a homogenous system

21
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:04,513
here. So in order to write down the solution set, we'll first need to find the reduced row echelon

22
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:09,853
form of the matrix that goes with that system, which conveniently

23
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:15,403
enough is the standard matrix for our linear transformation.

24
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:21,133
So we use a calculator here to compute this 1 2 0 0

25
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:26,883
0 0 1 0 in our last row and 0 0

26
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:32,143
0 1. So now what this tells us is

27
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:37,333
that we can write a simpler system. So our first row

28
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:42,933
says, whoops, that was supposed to be an X and that looks too much like a Y.

29
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:47,603
So let's try it again. That first row says X plus two

30
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:54,403
Y should give us zero. That's a better X. X plus two Y.

31
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:59,503
Leave a little space here. Our second row says Z

32
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:05,363
equals zero. And our last row says W equals

33
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:10,603
zero. So if we look up at our matrix, we have

34
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:15,603
three pivot columns and one non-pivot column. So our non pivot

35
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:23,553
column corresponds to a free variable. So that was y. We can let

36
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:29,603
y be our favorite letter. I usually go with a.

37
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:34,603
And then we can substitute in a for. Sorry

38
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:40,723
a for Y. And then we can solve for X here. So X should be -2a

39
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:45,733
Y should be a Z should be zero.

40
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:51,343
And then W should be zero. So our solution

41
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:56,603
set the kernel is going to be

42
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:02,603
all of the vectors of the form -2a a 0 0.

43
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:08,603
Such that a

44
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:14,603
is any real number. Now, to find a

45
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:20,233
basis for the kernel, it's just like we're working V9. We simply

46
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:29,053
need to know that we can factor out that free variable here.

47
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:33,603
And if we had additional free variables, we could factor those out as well. So

48
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:41,603
we end up with is a basis of

49
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:46,603
the kernel of T is simply

50
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:54,174
the single vector -2 1 0 0.
