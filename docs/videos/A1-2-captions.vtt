00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:07,235
In this video, we're going to see how to show that transformation between vector spaces is not a linear transformation.

2
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:11,405
So here I've written down a transformation team from the vector space of polynomial to the

3
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:19,535
vector space of polynomials given by T of a polynomial is X times that polynomial squared.

4
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:25,465
So we're going to show something is not a linear transformation. There's basically three things we could do.

5
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,765
We could show that it does not send the zero vector to the zero vector.

6
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:34,765
We could show that it does not respect addition and we can show that it does not respect scalar multiplication.

7
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:39,695
Any one of those three things will work. In this case, if I try and plug in the zero polynomial.

8
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:43,865
We're gonna get X times the zero polynomial squared, which is still zero.

9
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:49,705
So that sends the zero polynomial to the zero polynomial. So that one's not very helpful.

10
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:52,765
And this one, I will check scalar multiplication.

11
00:00:52,765 --> 00:01:00,765
So if this was gonna be linear, we would want to see that if we multiply a polynomial by a scalar and then apply our map T

12
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:05,735
That should be the same thing as if we apply our map T to the polynomial.

13
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:11,195
And then multiply by the scalar. So let's compute both of these things.

14
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:15,095
So first will apply T to C times F.

15
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:21,065
So our map says we're gonna take X. We're gonna multiply C, F of X times itself.

16
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:27,765
In other words, we get A squared. We do that. You see, we get C squared X and.

17
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:38,775
Of X squared. However, when we do c times T(f)

18
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:47,545
So this is X times F of X squared against C X.

19
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:57,115
F of X squared. And these two things are different in general, right, unless C is zero or one, C squared and C are not going to be the same thing.

20
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,765
So we've shown that T of C,

21
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:08,905
F of X is not the same thing as C times T(f(x)) for all polynomials F and all scalars C so T does not respect scalar multiplication.

22
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:11,891
So it cannot be a linear transformation.
