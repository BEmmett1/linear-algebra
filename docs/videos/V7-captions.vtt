00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:08,345
In this video, we're going to see how to find a basis for subspace of vector space.

2
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:16,345
So I have written down here a subspace of R^3 and I've produced it by a spanning set so we know W is spanned by.

3
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:22,345
These four vectors. Now unfortunately, we know these vectors are going to be linearly dependent.

4
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:30,165
In particular, we have too many of them to cram into R^3 and still have linear independence.

5
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:37,305
So we want to figure out which ones of these we can build out of the other ones and drop those from our set to make a basis.

6
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:47,345
So the way we'll do that is we'll go ahead and write down a matrix with these vectors as columns.

7
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:56,345
Negative six. Negative one, negative 19. And we'll compute the reduced row echelon form here.

8
00:00:56,345 --> 00:01:01,055
So I've typed this in to Wolfram Alpha ahead of time for convenience.

9
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:16,345
This produces the vector one two sorry, one zero two three zero one negative one negative four and zero zero zero two.

10
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:24,475
Now, the key thing to note here is these last two columns are non-pivot columns. In particular,

11
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:29,155
that tells us we can build them out of the columns that came before.

12
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:36,345
So that third column we can produce by taking two of the first column and negative one of the second column and fourth one we can produce.

13
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:43,315
Taking three of the first column, add it to negative four times the second column.

14
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:49,195
So those ones are redundant vectors. We don't need them. We can build them out of those first two vectors.

15
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:53,485
So if we drop them out, we're going to still span the same subspace.

16
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:58,345
If we drop both of them out, the resulting set will be linearly independent.

17
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:05,345
So we'll write down those two vectors that correspond to our pivot columns--two one negative one.

18
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:18,345
And three one four. So this is a basis.

19
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:27,765
Now, the second part asks for the dimension of W and the dimension of a vector space is just the number of vectors in any basis.

20
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:32,345
So I have a basis that we just wrote down. It has two vectors in it.

21
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:36,417
And so therefore, the dimension of W is two.
