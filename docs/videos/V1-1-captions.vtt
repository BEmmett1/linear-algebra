00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:09,545
In this video, we're going to see how to verify if a set with given operations satisfies one of the eight defining vector space properties.

2
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:11,605
So in this particular example I have here,

3
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:21,215
we have been given this set of all pairs of real numbers and we have a couple operations for addition and scalar multiplication defined for us.

4
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:27,905
And we're going to verify that scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition.

5
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:35,605
So the basic idea is that we want to compute the left and the right hand sides of this identity and see if we end up with the same thing.

6
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:44,605
So let's start with the left hand side. So we want to compute, c is some scalar and multiply it by some other two vectors.

7
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:51,875
(x_1,y_1) plus (x_2,y_2).

8
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:59,145
So the convention is to follow the usual order of operations here. So that means that will operate inside the parentheses first.

9
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:03,605
So we'll do this addition inside first. So I'm just going to write down.

10
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:09,795
what we're going to do next. And then we'll go ahead and add (x_1,y_1) to (x_2,y_2)

11
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:17,605
When I say add, I have this funny addition symbol here, which means that we're going to follow this addition operation up here.

12
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:24,605
So we add (x_1,y_1) to (x_2,y_2) we get 2x_1+2x_2

13
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:30,545
In the second spot we have 2y_1+2y_2

14
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:34,605
Now we are going to do the scalar multiplication, following the rule for scalar multiplication,

15
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:41,605
up here the scalar multiplication rule says multiply the first component by C and the second component by C squared.

16
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:49,605
That's exactly what we'll do. We'll write down a C times the first component.

17
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:58,605
And then we'll write down a C squared times that second component.

18
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:04,605
And now we just have regular old real number multiplication and addition in here so we can distribute this out as we normally would.

19
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:09,605
And write 2cx_1+2cx_2

20
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:13,605
And in the second spot 2c^2y_1+2c^2y_2.

21
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:23,605
Now we're going to compute the right hand side of this identity.

22
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:27,605
So we write down c times (x_1,y_1)

23
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:35,605
plus c times (x_2,y_2).

24
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:45,605
And once again, we're following our usual convention of the order of operations, which simply says do multiplication first.

25
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:50,605
We'll do both of those scalar multiplications and then we'll add the resulting vectors together.

26
00:02:50,605 --> 00:03:00,605
So to do scalar multiplication, our rule says multiply the first component by C and the second component by C squared.

27
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:10,165
So you get cx_1 and c^2y_1; for the second one will have cx_2 and c^2 y_2

28
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:15,895
Now, to add these two vectors together, we look at what our rule says to do, it says take the first components from each of them.

29
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,605
Multiply both by two and add them together.

30
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:27,605
The first component will take that cx_1 we'll multiply it by two and we'll add to that cx_2, which is the first component

31
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:34,585
of the second one multiplied by two. Now, what the rule says for the second spot is basically the same thing.

32
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:41,605
But with the second slots. So we'll take two times the second thing in the first one plus two times the second thing and the second one.

33
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:50,665
So two times in this case, we have c^2y_1 in the second spot of the first one plus c^2y_2 is in

34
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:56,845
the second spot and the second one and that gets multiplied by two and added to the.

35
00:03:56,845 --> 00:04:02,605
And now if we look, that is exactly what we got when we computed the left hand side.

36
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:09,955
So our Left-Hand side is equal to our right hand side. Which shows that our set with these two operations.

37
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:15,554
Has this identity that scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition.
