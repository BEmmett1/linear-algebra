00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:04,803
In this video, we're going to see how to determine if a given linear transformation

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:10,803
is injective or surjective. So let's start with

3
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:15,803
injective. So remember to test if or to figure out if a map is injective

4
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:21,203
or not, we want to figure out if different vectors go different places.

5
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:25,803
So what happens if we end up with two vectors,

6
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:32,693
T(v) and T(w) being the same?

7
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:36,803
So note that this is saying because T is linear

8
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:42,713
that T(v-w) is

9
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:48,203
equal to the zero vector.

10
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:52,803
So if different vectors are going to different places, we

11
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:58,343
should never have something going to the zero vector unless the v and w are the same

12
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:03,803
thing. In other words, T is going to be

13
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:09,743
injective exactly when the kernel

14
00:01:09,743 --> 00:01:21,803
only contains the zero vector.

15
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:27,303
So if we want to determine if our map is injective or not, we proceed as if we're going

16
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:32,343
to write down a basis for the kernel. We don't have to actually write that down, but we do

17
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:37,443
have to observe how many things are going to be in it. Right. So the zero vector is

18
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:42,843
always in the kernel because every linear transformation maps the zero vector to the zero vector.

19
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:47,803
As soon as we can see that there are more things in the kernel, then we know our map is not

20
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:52,803
injective. If we see that zero is the only thing in the kernel that we know our

21
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:58,263
map is injective. So let's look at this example. I have

22
00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:03,483
written down here and given my standard matrix written down there. If we wanted

23
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:08,803
to find the kernel of this linear transformation, we would think about the system of equations

24
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:13,803
producing zeros. So we would write down our

25
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:19,053
matrix going with the system, which is our standard matrix here and find it's reduced row echelon

26
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:23,803
form. So let's go ahead and

27
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:29,803
type this in the calculator. You end up with

28
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:34,803
1 2 0 0;  0 0 1 0;

29
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:42,803
0 0 0 1.

30
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:50,543
And now, I have actually done enough work to determine if this map is injective or not.

31
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:55,643
So the key observation here is that if I was going to write down the solution set, I would

32
00:02:55,643 --> 00:03:00,653
need to know if I have any free variables or not. So if

33
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:06,473
I am looking at this matrix here, I see a non pivot column

34
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:11,803
which corresponds to a free variable and that free variable is going to correspond to having

35
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:16,803
infinitely many things in the solution set. So in this case we know that

36
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:23,693
we have a non pivot column. So column two

37
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:30,803
is a non pivot column.

38
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:36,723
Which tells us that the kernel of T has

39
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:46,803
infinitely many vectors.

40
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:53,803
So our map T is not.

41
00:03:53,803 --> 00:04:00,803
injective.

42
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:05,803
All right, so that tells us if our map is injectiveor not, but we

43
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:11,803
also want to know if our map is surjective, which is a completely separate

44
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:16,803
question. So a map is going to be surjective when the image

45
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:22,123
fills up the entire codomain, in this case R^3. And we

46
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:27,223
know how to write down a basis for the image of our linear transformation. In this case, we would

47
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:32,383
take our columns that correspond to the pivot columns. So in this case, the first,

48
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:37,393
the third and the fourth column here. So I'm not going to write that

49
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:48,643
down. All right. I'm going to note is the dimension of the image.

50
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:52,803
So we have three pivot columns, which means I was going to write down three vectors in that basis

51
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:58,803
so the dimension of the image is three, which is the dimension

52
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:04,803
of the codomain in this case, R^3.

53
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:09,803
Let me emphasize here that this was the codomain

54
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:14,803
And the only three dimensional

55
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:21,283
subspace of a three dimensional space is the whole thing itself.

56
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:25,803
So this tells us that the image of T is actually equal

57
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:32,803
to all of the codomain . So therefore

58
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:40,803
this map T is surjective.

59
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:48,373
So we have determined that our map is not injective and it is surjective.

60
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:52,803
So one important point to note is that these are completely independent kinds of questions. There

61
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:57,803
are four different things that can happen. Your map can be both injective and surjective. It

62
00:05:57,803 --> 00:06:02,803
could be injective, but not surjective. It could be not injective

63
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:09,403
and surjective like this one. Or it can be neither injective nor surjective.

64
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:13,257
So on each one, it's going to be separate things that you need to check.
