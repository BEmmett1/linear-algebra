00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:06,298
In this video, we're going to learn how to find a basis of the eigenspace associated

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:11,298
to a given eigenvalue. Just a quick reminder, remember that

3
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:19,558
an eigenvector.

4
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:25,298
Is a vector that simply gets stretched out when we do matrix multiplication.

5
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:30,298
So another way of saying this is that when you multiply it by A you just get some scalar

6
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:35,298
times your vector back. So if we're handed an eigenvalue Lambda and

7
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:41,638
we're trying to find the eigenvectors. We just need to find the vectors that satisfy A X equals

8
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:46,828
lambda X. And when we do that is similar to when we're finding eigenvalues

9
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:54,298
will rearrange this in fact around. And so we're looking.

10
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:59,988
When there's (A minus lambda I) X equals zero.

11
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:04,298
And to rephrase this in terms of things we've learned before. This is saying that X

12
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:09,298
is an element of the kernel of A minus

13
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:15,298
lambda I. So if we're trying to find a basis on the eigenspace,

14
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:22,298
we're just trying to find a basis of the kernel of a particular linear transformation.

15
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:27,298
All right, so for this particular problem written in black here, we want to find a basis of the eigenspace

16
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:32,298
associated to that value negative three for this matrix A.

17
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:37,298
So we're going to try and find the kernel of A minus negative three I. So the first

18
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:43,298
thing we'll do is we'll write down A minus negative three I

19
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:48,298
Which is the same thing as a plus 3 I

20
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:54,198
So, the identity matrix is ones on the diagonal.

21
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:59,388
So three times the identity matrix is threes on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else. So

22
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:06,018
3 to the first spot. We'll add a three

23
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:11,098
second spot of the second row. 3 to the third

24
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:17,298
spot of the third group and in the fourth row will add a 3.

25
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:22,298
to the fourth spot. But

26
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:33,038
In order to find the kernel, we'll need to do the reduced row echelon form.

27
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:38,298
I've gone ahead and typed into a calculator and we end up with

28
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:43,298
1 4 0 -1;  0 0 1 2;

29
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:55,298
and then 2 rows without a pivot.

30
00:02:55,298 --> 00:03:01,298
So now if we look at our reduced matrix here, we see two.

31
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:06,298
non-pivot columns, so we'll have two free variables so they can, let's say

32
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:14,298
x2 equals A and x4 equals b.

33
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:19,298
And now our first row says x 1 plus 4 x 2 2

34
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:25,298
is a, so I'll go ahead and write in a there in there,  minus X 4, which was b.

35
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:31,298
Should be equal to zero of course, and x 2 is a.Our second row says x3

36
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:39,298
minus 2 x4s -- x4 was b--should also be0.

37
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:44,298
So now we just look at our first and third equation and solve for x1 and x3, we'll have x1

38
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:50,298
is negative four a plus b; x2 is a; x3 is 2b; x4 is b.

39
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:55,818
This will allow us to write down the kernel of A minus negative 3 I.

40
00:03:55,818 --> 00:04:00,298
3. By.

41
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:06,298
So all of our vectors -- we said x1 is negative 4a plus b

42
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:21,818
x2 is a; x3 is 2b; X four isb.

43
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:28,298
And now we simply want to note that this is the span of two vectors.

44
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:33,298
From the a's, we have a -4 1 0 0

45
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:42,628
and from the b's we have 1 0 2 1.

46
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:47,298
So those two vectors are linearly independent. So our set of these

47
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:54,298
two vectors. -4 1 0 0.

48
00:04:54,298 --> 00:05:00,808
And 1 0 2 1.

49
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:06,298
This is a basis.

50
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:13,298
of the eigenspace.

51
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:18,298
So as I've written that it's slightly ambiguous because every eigenvalue is going to have their own eigenspace.

52
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:23,298
But in this particular context, we've only talked about one eigenvalue. So it's clear that the

53
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:29,298
eigenspace we're talking about here is associated this eigenvalue negative three.

54
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:34,298
If whatever you're working on, you're talking about multiple eigenvalues. You should then say which eigenspace you're talking

55
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:38,121
about down here for this context.
