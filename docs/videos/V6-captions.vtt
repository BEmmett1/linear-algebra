1
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:10,908
So the key idea here is that we need to check two things to see if something is a basis.

2
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:24,908
We need to check if this set is linearly independent, and that it also--independent--and that it also spans R^3.

3
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:36,448
So there's two things to check here. The good news is it's fairly straightforward to check both these things at the same time.

4
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:44,908
So what we'll do is we'll write down a matrix corresponding to the system where these are on the left hand side.

5
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:56,028
So that would be the matrix's first column is 2 1 -1, the second column 3 1 4, and the third column is 7 0 3.

6
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:58,908
For thinking about whether this set is linearly independent or not,

7
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:06,908
we would augment with zeros and ask ourselves how many ways are there to build the zero vector? For asking if it spansR^3 or not,

8
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:15,648
We would augment with an arbitrary vector b and ask ourselves whether we can always find a solution no matter what b is.

9
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:20,008
The answers to both of those questions really only depend on what's going on on the left hand side.

10
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:25,908
So go ahead and write down the left hand side and compute the reduced row echelon form here.

11
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:36,908
So I typed this into Wolfram Alpha, and it has spit out the matrix one zero zero zero one zero zero zero one.

12
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:42,918
All right. So for the first question of linear independence, we want to know if we augment this with zeros,

13
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:45,908
How many solutions do we have augmented with zeros?

14
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:49,908
We noticed that the solution--the system will look like x1=0,

15
00:01:49,908 --> 00:02:04,908
x2=0, and x3=0. So they only have the trivial solution, which tells us that we're linearly independent.

16
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:11,908
Now we want to know if this spans R^3 or not. So now we want to ask ourselves no matter  what I augment with over there.

17
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:18,908
Are we going to have a solution? And sure enough, no matter what I would augment with over here, it really doesn't matter what ends up over here--

18
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:23,908
Our system is still going to look the same. It's going to look like x1 equals whatever is up here.

19
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:28,178
x2 equals whatever is here. x3 equals whatever is here.

20
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:31,908
So we do always have a solution. No matter what happens over there.

21
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:37,908
So we do span R^3. So we're linearly independent and we span R^3.

22
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,865
Therefore, we are a basis of R^3.
