00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:05,686
In this video, we're going to learn how to find the eigenvalues of a matrix.

2
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:10,726
So remember. The key idea

3
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:20,726
of a value being an eigenvalue.

4
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:25,726
Is that we're scaling a vector when

5
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:30,726
we do a multiplication. So in other words, λ is an

6
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:36,726
eigenvalue if A X equals λ for some non zero X.

7
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:42,726
And another way of interpreting that is that if we subtract the λX over to the other side and factor

8
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:47,726
out that if we do A minus λ times X equals

9
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:55,726
zero for some nonzero X.

10
00:00:55,726 --> 00:01:00,726
So in other words, what we're doing is we're looking for a non-zero element of the kernel of

11
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:05,726
A- λI. For a square matrix, we know that

12
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:10,726
the kernel is going to be non-trivial exactly when A- λI

13
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:16,726
is not invertible.

14
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:21,726
And one way to see that A- λI is not invertible is to look

15
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:26,726
at its determinant. You know, an invertible matrix has to have a non-zero determinant.

16
00:01:26,726 --> 00:01:32,726
And if our determinant is zero, we're not invertible. So our technique for finding

17
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:37,726
the eigenvalues is to compute the determinant of A- λI and figure out what values

18
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:42,726
of λmake it equal to zero. So let's look at this with our particular

19
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:47,726
A here. First thing we want to do is write down A minus λ times

20
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:54,106
the identity. So this is 3  7 ; 2 -2

21
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:58,726
subtract off λ times the identity, well, we multiply our 1 0 0 1 by

22
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:04,346
λ, we get λ 0 0 λ. In other words, we have

23
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:08,726
three minus λ, seven to and negative to

24
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:14,726
minus λ, so to compute the determinant of

25
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:20,726
A-λI. We're now doing the determinant of a two by two matrix,

26
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:25,726
so we'll multiply our diagonal entries -- -2 minus λhere.

27
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:30,726
We'll subtract off two times seven

28
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:37,176
our antidiagonal entries. So now we just need to do a little bit of manipulation

29
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:41,726
and find the roots of this polynomial, which is quadratic in λ. Let's

30
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:46,726
expand this out. Looks like a λ squared, then minus

31
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:54,726
λ and minus six and minus 14 from the two times

32
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:59,906
λ squared minus λminus 20.

33
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:04,726
And now to find the roots we can just factor. Looks like λ minus five

34
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:10,806
times λplus four will do the trick. So λequals

35
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:16,236
five and negative four are the roots of this polynomial.

36
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:20,128
So they are the eigenvalues of our matrix A.
