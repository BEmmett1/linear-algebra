00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:18,020
In this video, we're going to look at a Setliff two operations and see how to show that it is not a vector space.

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,560
So here I have a set of all pairs of real numbers and you have to keep in operations here.

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,600
I don't want to think about our eight vector space properties in which one we think is most likely to fail.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,360
So in this particular example, I look at the addition in the scale and multiplication there,

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,840
and I think the addition looks a little bit funny, or maybe then these scalar multiplication.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,660
Now, the addition does look like it's probably going to be competitive,

7
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,450
because if I swap the roles of the the ones in the twos, I end up with the same thing.

8
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,480
But I'm a little skeptical about the associativity here.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,690
So remember, associativity means that we add three of these things together.

10
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,120
There's two ways we could choose to do that, and we hope that would give us the same thing.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:17,630
Clemmy, write down exactly what I mean there. So we can take X one, Y one and we can add that two X to Y too.

12
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:25,810
And we can add this two X three Y three.

13
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,910
Now, one regular old addition. It doesn't matter which one of those additions operations we do first.

14
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:40,580
So that's the associative property that we're trying to check here. So one way we can do this is the first at X one by one, X two, y two.

15
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:47,000
So I want to know that by putting parentheses here and the other way, we could do this to take X one, Y one.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,150
But first, add X to Y to.

17
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:05,490
Two x three, y three. All right, so let's compare both of these out and see if we get the same result.

18
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,750
So let's do the top one first so we'll add X one, Y one to X to Y two.

19
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,950
So by our definition, that's two X one plus two X two, two Y one plus two, one, two.

20
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:30,500
So what was the Y? And we're going to add this two x three Y three.

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,970
All right. So this addition is maybe slightly trickier, but we're just going to look at our role here.

22
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,510
And this says, we're going to take two times the first component of the first one.

23
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:50,750
Add it to two times the first component of the second one. So the first component, the first one here is now two x one plus two x two.

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:59,280
And then we're going to add that to two times the first component of the second one in this case, that takes three.

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,830
And similarly for the wives, two times the second component of the first one.

26
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:17,190
So that be the two. Why one plus two wives who. And then we have to add to that two times the second component of the second one.

27
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:29,250
So in this case, that's why three. And now we have some regular old real number arithmetic here.

28
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:38,460
So if we distribute this out, we have, I think for X one plus four x two plus two x three.

29
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:48,750
And the Y component we have for Y one plus four Y two plus two Y.

30
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:57,450
And that's for the first one. So now we're going to simplify the second one down there.

31
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:05,130
So first, I'm just going to copy down the x1 y one because we're gonna do the other additions first.

32
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:18,980
Now we do this. You end up with two x two plus two X three and two Y two plus two Y three.

33
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:25,960
And once again, the second edition is maybe slightly trickier, but it's not too bad.

34
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,750
So here we'll take two times the first component of the first one. Again, the first component, the first one here is X ones.

35
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:38,830
That's not too terrible. But now this X two is referring to the first component of the second one.

36
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:49,480
So two tons, whatever's in the first slot of the second one, which I see is two x two plus two x three.

37
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,170
And now for the second component, it will have the two Y one.

38
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,870
But now will take two times whatever is the second component of the second one.

39
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:06,000
So in this case, two y two was two y three.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:17,550
And once again, now we can just do some real number arithmetic here and distribute and have two x one plus four x two plus four x three.

41
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:28,100
And in the second spot, we have two Y one plus four Y two plus four Y three.

42
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:38,610
All right, so now we just want to look at the change colors here.

43
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,520
We just want to look at these two and see if they're the same.

44
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,550
And now pretty clearly they're not the same. We have four x one in the top and a two X one in the bottom.

45
00:05:49,550 --> 00:06:03,410
And same thing for the X threes. These are not equal. So addition is not associative.

46
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:17,857
And therefore, this thing B is not a vector space.
