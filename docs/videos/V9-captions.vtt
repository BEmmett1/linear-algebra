00:00:00,972 --> 00:00:08,052
In this video, we're going to see how to find the basis of a solution set for a homogenous system of equations.

2
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:17,052
We have a homogenous system written down here. And the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna solve it just like we're working on a E3 problem.

3
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:23,052
So to do that, we'll write down the corresponding augmented matrix here.

4
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:34,052
So two, three one negative six zero one one one negative one zero.

5
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:41,052
Negative one  four negative six  negative 19  and zero.

6
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:46,052
And the first thing we'll do is compute the reduced row echelon form to

7
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:56,052
give us a simpler system to deal with. So go ahead and type this in to Wolfram Alpha.

8
00:00:56,052 --> 00:01:08,052
It is one zero two three zero zero one negative one negative four zero, and the bottom row is all zeros.

9
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:21,440
So this corresponds to the simpler system,x1+2x3+3x4 is zero

10
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:31,440
And then x2-x3-4x4=0

11
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Now we look at our matrix here, go ahead and circle those pivots if we like.

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,440
And we see that leaves us with two non-pivot columns.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:56,560
So those are free variables. So we can let, say, x3 be a and x4 be b and we can rewrite our system in terms of x3 is a and x4 is b,

14
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,440
So we'll do that over here.

15
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:16,440
So we have x1+2a+3b equal to zero  x2-a-4b is equal to zero; we said x3 was a and x4 was b.

16
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Now as soon as we solve for x1 and x2 in these first two, we'll be able to write down our solution set.

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:32,440
So x1 is -2a-3b, x2 is a+4b

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,440
x3 was a, x4 was b.

19
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:56,440
So our solution set is the set of all vectors of the form -2a-3b, a+4b, a, b.

20
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Such that a and b are real numbers.

21
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Now, the key thing to note here is that this vector can be split this up as a vector containing A's and a vector containing B's.

22
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,440
So the a part looks like this and the b part looks like.

23
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,160
Negative three b, four b,  zero, b.

24
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:34,440
And note that that's the same thing as a times negative two one one zero.

25
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Plus b times negative three four zero one.

26
00:03:41,440 --> 00:04:00,440
So our solution set here is actually. The span of these two vectors, negative two one one zero and negative three four zero one.

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
So we know our solution set is spanned by those two vectors.

28
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,440
So now what we need to do is find a linearly independent subset of those two vectors to have a basis.

29
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:22,180
The good news is because we have these two free variables, we know that these two vectors are always going to end up being linearly independent.

30
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,200
In fact, just look at these last two components, the one zero zero one.

31
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:54,516
So. We write down a set containing these two vectors, negative two one one zero and negative three four zero one.
