00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:06,102
In this video, we're going to learn how to find the inverse of a matrix

2
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:11,102
that we know to be invertible. So to start with, let's suppose we have

3
00:00:11,102 --> 00:00:17,102
a linear transformation from R^3 to R^3 that we know has an inverse map.

4
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:22,102
T inverse. So the basic idea is if I want to write down the standard

5
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:27,102
matrix for T inverse, I need to know what T

6
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:32,102
inverse of e1 is. That would give me the first column

7
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:37,102
T inverse of e2, our second basis vector,  would give us the second column

8
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:43,102
and T inverse of e3 will give us the third column.

9
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:48,102
So I don't know what these are. I'm just gonna give them names for the moment. v1, v2, and v3.

10
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:55,102
Whatever those are, those will give me the three columns of our matrix.

11
00:00:55,102 --> 00:01:01,102
But note that saying that T inverse of e1 is equal to v1, what

12
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:06,102
T inverse does is it's gonna send e1 back where it came from.

13
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:12,102
So what that tells us is that T(v1)

14
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:17,102
had to be e1. And we want to know where e1 came from

15
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:23,102
to send it back to. And same thing T(v2)

16
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:30,102
needs to be e2 and T(v3)

17
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:35,382
needs to be e3. So that's

18
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:41,142
the idea in principle. So let's look at an example with an actual

19
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:46,102
concrete matrix and we'll see how this works.

20
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:52,102
So let's suppose we have the map given by the matrix A -- 1 2 1,

21
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:57,102
2 5 1

22
00:01:57,102 --> 00:02:04,102
-2 -5 0

23
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:10,122
All right, so if we want to figure out what v1 is, we need to figure out what A

24
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:19,102
maps to each one. So we kind of want to solve.

25
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:27,102
Ax produces e1.

26
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:32,552
So if we're thinking about that as an augmented matrix, we have A

27
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:37,632
two five one negative to negative five zero.

28
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:45,252
And we want to produce the vector one zero, zero.

29
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:54,102
And as usual, we're solving this system, so we'll compute the reduced row echelon form.

30
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:59,102
And we've produced the Matrix 1 0 0; 0 1 0

31
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:04,102
0 0 1. And we have

32
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:12,312
5 -2 0

33
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:17,352
So note that the left side here to the left of our augmented bar better

34
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:22,102
be the identity matrix because the left side here is just the row

35
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:27,612
reduced form of A. And so this simpler

36
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:33,102
system here is telling us that the first component is 5. The second component is 2. The last component

37
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:38,102
is zero. So now we know that T inverse e one,

38
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:44,102
that thing we're calling v1 is the vector

39
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:49,102
5 -2 0

40
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:54,102
All right. So that's gonna be the first column of A inverse. Maybe I will

41
00:03:54,102 --> 00:04:00,102
change colors and write that up here. A Inverse.

42
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:08,042
The first column is 5 -2 0.

43
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:15,102
In our second column, we'll need to solve.

44
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:21,102
A X equals e2. So now

45
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:26,102
instead of augmenting with the vector 1 0 0 augment with the vector 0 1 0.

46
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:37,102
The left side is going to look the same.

47
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:42,262
We'll compute our reduced row echelon form, not surprisingly, to

48
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:48,102
the left of the augmented bar, we get the identity matrix again.

49
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:55,102
And now we produce the vector -5 -2 1

50
00:04:55,102 --> 00:05:01,582
So this tells us that that vector v2 we were looking for

51
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:07,102
is equal to negative 5, negative 2

52
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:12,102
1. So T maps negative 5 negative 2 1 to our vector e2

53
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:23,102
So T inverse of e2 is negative 5 negative 2 and 1.

54
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:28,102
And finally, we'll do the same thing for our last basis vector we want

55
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:34,102
to solve A X equals e3.

56
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:40,102
So we'll do the reduced row echelon form

57
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:49,672
Now we're going to augment with e3.

58
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:55,102
Once again, type that in calculator and we produce

59
00:05:55,102 --> 00:06:00,322
1 0 0 ; 0 1 0; 0 0 1;

60
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:05,242
And this gets augmented with negative 3 1 1.

61
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:10,242
Tells us that t of the vector -3 1 1

62
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:16,242
produces the vector 0 0 1

63
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:21,242
which is equivalent to saying that

64
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:27,242
T inverse of e3 ( 0 0 1 )

65
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:32,242
is -3 1 1. So that's our third

66
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:42,012
column of A inverse.

67
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:49,242
So this is our inverse matrix right here.

68
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:54,962
So one thing to noteis that if we're gonna do all these reductions by hand,

69
00:06:54,962 --> 00:07:00,092
we think about kind of our algorithm moving from left to right across the matrix.

70
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:05,232
Here we're gonna do the same moves in all of these.

71
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:10,332
Three different row reductions we did. And what's happening to the right of the augmented bar is just

72
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:15,492
keeping track of what those moves are. So you can save yourself a little bit

73
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:20,242
of punching in the calculator here. If instead

74
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:26,232
you look at the matrix write down A

75
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:32,242
to 1 to 5 1 and negative 2 negative

76
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:37,482
and you can go ahead and augment with all three

77
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:48,592
of these at the same time.

78
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:54,182
And you can check if you type it in your calculator. What you end up with on the left side

79
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,282
is exactly as before because we're still doing the same moves. And on the right side, the first

80
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:04,352
column is what we got the first time. Second column is what we

81
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:11,342
got. The second time and the third column is what we got.

82
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:16,402
The third time. So kind of a shorter way of saying this

83
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:22,832
is that if you do the reduced row echelon form.

84
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:28,552
Your matrix, a augmented with the identity matrix.

85
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:35,442
You're going to produce the identity matrix augmented with.

86
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:40,812
The inverse matrix. So you can use this to save yourself a little bit of time typing

87
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:46,542
this into your calculator. You really only have to type one thing in here instead of doing three different

88
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:47,730
matrices.
