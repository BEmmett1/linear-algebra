1
00:00:01,908 --> 00:00:07,368
In this video, we're going to discuss how to multiply matrices.

2
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:12,708
So the basic idea is that matrix multiplication is composing

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:17,818
linear maps. So we have one linear map that takes you from one vector space to another.

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:23,658
And then we follow that up with a second linear map that comes from the codomain of the first map

5
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:28,818
into another vector space. So here I have written

6
00:00:28,818 --> 00:00:33,818
down two linear transformations S goes from R^4 to R^2 and T

7
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:38,818
goes from R^3 to R^4. So what this means

8
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:45,818
is that we can chain these together in the following way. So T

9
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:50,818
Starts in R^3 and produces something in

10
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:55,818
R^4. So I'm going to label this with a T here,

11
00:00:55,818 --> 00:01:02,818
but S takes things in R^4 and produces things.

12
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:07,818
R^2. So we can take a vector in R^3, apply

13
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:13,818
T to it to produce a vector in R^4 and to that resulting vector, we can apply S to

14
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:18,818
it and produce a vector in R^2. So this means we get a

15
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:23,818
composition map, going from R^3 to R^4

16
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:29,868
which is S composed with T.

17
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:34,888
At first glance, that might seem a little bit backwards,

18
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:40,198
but remember where these are compositions of functions and when we think about applying

19
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:45,268
functions, we apply from right to left. So if we are gonna take a vector and plug this in first,

20
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:51,388
we plug it into T and then we would take the result and plug it in to S.

21
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:56,668
So if we're talking about multiplying matrices, what we really want to do is by definition

22
00:01:56,668 --> 00:02:00,818
just write down the standard matrix for the composition map. So our composition map

23
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:06,748
here is S composed with T. So the standard matrix for S

24
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:12,628
composed with T is going to be the matrix A B by definition.

25
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:18,107
So. My pen

26
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:31,227
A, B. Is the standard matrix.

27
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:37,227
of S composed T -- put a nice box around this because that

28
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:42,697
is the definition of

29
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:48,637
multiplying these matrices. All right. So how do we actually do this?

30
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:54,227
So the standard matrix, the columns are just given by what happens to

31
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:59,227
our standard basis vectors. So all we have to do is figure out what the map S composed

32
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:04,227
withT does to our standard basis vectors. So let's start

33
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:09,227
with our first standard basis vector e1.

34
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:16,227
So we're going to take e1. First we're gonna plug it into T. And whatever we get out of there, we're gonna plug into S.

35
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:21,487
So the good news is that it's very easy to plug into T. We just have to look at the first column

36
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:26,557
of the standard matrix for T and the standard matrix for T we call

37
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:31,227
B. So all we have to do is write down the first column

38
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:36,227
of B here. So 1 -1 2 3.

39
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:41,227
And now we're going to take

40
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:48,897
that resulting vector, 1 -1 2 3, and plug it in to S.

41
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:54,227
So remember, what this means is we're doing a linear combination of the columns of the standard matrix

42
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:59,227
for S because this vector 1 -1 2 3 is a linear

43
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:05,097
combination of our standard basis vectors. So that says we need to do one times the first column.

44
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:10,777
The standard matrix of S which we are calling A. So the first column of A

45
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:17,227
and then minus one times the second column.

46
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:24,917
And plus, two times the third column (which is 0 4)

47
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:29,227
And plus three times the last column.

48
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:35,237
2 -2. So now we just have to do a little

49
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:42,227
bit of arithmetic here. So on the top, I think we get a five

50
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:48,227
on the bottom I believe we get four.

51
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:53,227
So that's gonna be the first column of our Matrix A B. Maybe I'll

52
00:04:53,227 --> 00:05:00,227
change colors and write this over here,

53
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:05,227
So AB --  the first

54
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:11,227
column is 5 4.

55
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:17,377
To get the second column, we need to apply our map S composed with T

56
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:22,227
to our second standard basis vector. So

57
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:27,227
remember to figure out what T does to e2. We're just gonna look at the second column

58
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:32,807
of B up there, which  is 0 1 4 5.

59
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:39,227
4 by.

60
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:44,897
And to figure out what S does to 0 1 4 5 0, that'll be 0 times the first column

61
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:52,227
of A. So 0 times 2 1.

62
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:58,227
Plus, one times the second column, 3 -1

63
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:04,917
plus four times the third column, 0 4

64
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:10,227
and plus five times that last column.

65
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:15,387
2 -2. Once

66
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:21,227
again, we do a little bit of arithmetic. And we get

67
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:26,697
13 5. So that is going to be

68
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:31,227
our second column of The Matrix

69
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:40,227
AB.

70
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:45,917
The domain of our composition map was R^3, so we've got one more basis vector

71
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:51,227
to go, which means our matrix A.B is going to have one more column.

72
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:56,447
So first we'll take e3 and plug it into T. So we're looking at

73
00:06:56,447 --> 00:07:02,287
the third column of our Matrix B now.

74
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:10,227
Looks like we have 6, 7, 8, 9.

75
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:15,227
Now, that says we'll do six times the first column of A -- 2 1,

76
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:20,227
plus 7 times the second column.

77
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:26,227
3 -1 plus eight times the third column.

78
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:31,227
0 4. And nine times

79
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:40,517
the last column 2 -2.

80
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:45,927
And here we get fifty one and the top spot and 13

81
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:51,227
in the second spot.

82
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:56,227
So that is our third column of AB.

83
00:07:56,227 --> 00:08:02,397
51 13

84
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:08,967
So that is how we multiply two matrices.

85
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:14,187
So I want to note a couple of things about this. So one,

86
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:19,227
we can't always multiply two matrices. So one of the key things that had to happen

87
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:24,627
was the codomain of our map T had to be the same as the domain of

88
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:29,227
our map. S What that means for our matrices is that the number

89
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:34,227
of columns of A which is telling us the dimension of

90
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:40,227
the domain of S had to match up with the number of rows of B

91
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:45,227
which is telling us the coodomain of T. So those have both have to be the same. In this case

92
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:52,227
4, telling us the codomain of T and the domain of S or both R^4.

93
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:57,387
The other thing I want to noteis that as soon as we draw this picture up here, then we

94
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:02,227
know what size are Matrix A B is going to be. So the

95
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:07,227
domain is R^3, which tells us we're going to have three columns because we're going to have a

96
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:12,227
column for every basis vector of our domain. And the codomain is going to

97
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:17,577
be well, codomain is R^2, but the number of rows is going to

98
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:22,227
be two because remember, each column is an output vector of this.

99
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:27,987
So each column better have be an element of our R2. So we are guaranteed to have exactly two

100
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:29,506
rows.
