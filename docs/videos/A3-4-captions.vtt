00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,630
In this video, we're going to verify the Rank-Nullity Theorem for a given linear transformation.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:14,110
So here I have a map from R^4 to R^3.  I've given it by saying, what happens to the vector X, Y, z.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:33,820
W. So the first thing we're going to want to do is write down the standard matrix for our linear transformation.

4
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:52,630
And we'll compute the reduced row echelon form. So I've gone ahead and type this into Wolfram Alpha.

5
00:00:52,630 --> 00:01:04,630
And that's what we get. I'm going to go ahead and circle our pivots.

6
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:11,320
Right now, the Rank-Nullity Theorem says that if we take the rank, which is the dimension of the image, and the nullity,

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,630
which is the dimension of the kernel, the sum of those two things should be the dimension of the domain.

8
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:24,160
So looking at what's going on here, probably the -- sorry, the rank is a little bit easier to see -- it's the dimension of the image.

9
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,210
So the image is spanned by the columns of our standard matrix.

10
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,630
So if you're going to write down a basis for the image, we would simply take the columns that correspond to the pivot columns.

11
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:51,630
So we have two pivot columns. So the rank is going to be two.

12
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,380
Now, the nullity is the dimension of the kernel. So the kernel, remember, is all the things that get mapped to the zero vector.

13
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,260
So we think about solving how to produce the zero vector out of the image here.

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,950
So we'll be solving the homogenous system where we augmented this with the zero vector.

15
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,630
And if you're trying to write down the basis of that homogenous system,

16
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,630
we would be looking for free variables which would tell us what the dimension of that solution set is.

17
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,630
So the free variables come from the non pivot columns. So that would be the third and the fourth column.

18
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:40,630
So we have two non pivot columns. So this tells us that the nullity, the dimension of the kernel, is also two.

19
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:46,490
And all the Rank-Nullity Theorem is saying is that the number of pivot columns

20
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,990
plus the number of non pivot columns better give you the number of columns.

21
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:58,630
Right. The number of columns is the dimension of the domain because we have one column for every basis vector of the domain.

22
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:14,974
So the Rank-Nullity Theorem here is saying that two plus two gives us four because four is the dimension of the domain.
