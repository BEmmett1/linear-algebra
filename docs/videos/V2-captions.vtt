00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:07,141
This video, we're going to see how to determine if a given vector is a linear combination of some other vectors.

2
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:14,331
So here right now, the question is is the vector [3,4,3] a linear combination of these other three vectors.

3
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:19,141
So our first step is to unpack this definition of what it means to be a linear combination.

4
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:31,141
So what we're saying here is that there's some scalars--maybe there's x_1, x_2, x_3--that we can multiply by these three vectors-- [2,1,-1]

5
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:38,141
Plus, maybe an x_2 [3,1,4]

6
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:45,141
And maybe an x_3 [7,0,3]

7
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:51,141
We want to know if we can produce the vector [3,4,3]

8
00:00:51,141 --> 00:01:01,141
Out of those other three vectors, by  the addition and scalar multiplication by some scalars x_1, x_2, x_3.

9
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:07,141
So we're really asking here is does this vector equation

10
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:21,161
have a solution? If it does, then we're able to build the vector [3,4,3] out of the other three.

11
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:25,241
And if not, then we're unable to. All right.

12
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:30,141
So we have a vector equation that we want to solve. So we can think about this as a system of equations.

13
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:35,141
So in which case, we'll want to write down an augmented matrix representing this system and compute its

14
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:41,141
reduced row echelon form, just like we're solving an E3 problem.

15
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:52,141
So the matrix we're interested in here. So 2 1 -1; 3 1 4; 7 0 3

16
00:01:52,141 --> 00:02:03,321
And we're trying to produce the vector [3 4 3]. So this augmented matrix here corresponds exactly with our vector equation above.

17
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:10,141
So we'll go ahead and compute our reduced row echelon form. So we'll type that in our favorite calculator.

18
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:28,601
I went ahead and did this on Wolfram Alpha. And this produced the following matrix.

19
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:35,141
All right. So now we have the reduced row echelon form. We can write down the corresponding system of equations for the reduced row

20
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:41,141
echelon form and we can then write-- determine if we have solutions or not.

21
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:50,141
So in particular, our first equation says x_1 is 2; our second equation, says x_2 s 2.

22
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:56,121
And our third equation says x_3 is -1.

23
00:02:56,121 --> 00:03:00,051
So not only do we have a solution, we have a unique solution. Right.

24
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:07,341
So the only scalars that worked for this are two, two and negative one, respectively.

25
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:14,271
So this means the answer to our question. In blue here is, yes, this system does have a solution.

26
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:21,141
So, yes, this vector three, four, three is a linear combination of those other three vectors in particular.

27
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:28,261
It's two times the first one plus two times the second one plus negative one times the third one.
