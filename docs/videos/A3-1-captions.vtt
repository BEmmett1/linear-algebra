00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:06,215
In this video, we're going to learn the definition of the kernel and the image of

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:11,215
a linear transformation. So let's suppose we have a linear transformation T

3
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:16,325
going from a domain of R^4, a codomain of R^3 given by the standard

4
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:22,085
matrix that I have written down here. So our first definition

5
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:27,215
is of the image of a linear transformation.

6
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:32,495
And basically the image is just all the things in the codomain that get mapped to

7
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:37,595
by something in the domain. So if I wanted to write this down formally, we

8
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:43,215
can say the image of T is defined by

9
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:48,215
the set of all things in the codomain. So I'll say maybe the set of all vectors v

10
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:53,215
in our codomain, which in this case is R^3,

11
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:59,215
such that. It gets mapped to

12
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:07,215
by something from the domain. So there's some w

13
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:12,215
in our domain, which in this case is R^4,  that T sends

14
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:19,795
over to v. So for a quick example here.

15
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:25,045
We can see that if I take the vector, say, 2 1

16
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:30,855
3 0 and apply T to that

17
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:35,215
quick computation shows and this is a quick practice

18
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:41,215
of standard A2 if you like, that we get 10, 5, 9

19
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:47,785
out. So this tells us that the vector 10,

20
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:54,215
5, 9 is in the image

21
00:01:54,215 --> 00:02:00,215
of T. This one is a capital I. So

22
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:05,215
that's all the image is -- all the things in the codomain that there is something in the domain that gets mapped

23
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:11,125
to them. In a later video, we'll talk about how to actually describe all

24
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:16,275
of those things. The other definition we want to do here is what's called

25
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:21,215
a kernel of a linear transformation. So the kernel, instead

26
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:27,215
of being a subspace of the codomain, is a subspace of the domain.

27
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:32,215
And the kernel is--I always think of this as all the things in the domain that get squished down

28
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:39,215
to the zero vector. So kernel of T

29
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:46,855
is the set of all vectors b in the domain R^4

30
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:51,215
such that T sends it to the

31
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:58,765
zero vector. So all the things that get mapped to the zero vector.

32
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:03,215
So for a quick example,

33
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:09,215
if I apply T to the vector -2, 1, 0,0

34
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:14,485
then for the moment I've just pulled this vector out of

35
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:19,215
a hat and in a later video we'll talk about where it comes from. But we can

36
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:25,135
check really quickly again, practicing A2, that we get the vector

37
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:30,625
0 0 0 out. So because of that,

38
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:36,055
that tells us that the vector negative 2 1 0

39
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:41,215
0 is an element

40
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:46,215
of the kernel of this linear transformation.

41
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:51,985
In later videos, we'll talk about how to find all the vectors in the image and

42
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,632
all the vectors in the kernel.
