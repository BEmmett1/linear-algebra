00:00:00,624 --> 00:00:05,624
In this video, we're going to quickly describe the definitions of injective and surjective

2
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:10,624
linear transformations. So suppose we're given a linear transformation

3
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:15,624
T from V to W; so V and W can be any vector spaces. But if you

4
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:20,624
like, think of them as Euclidean spaces. So the first definition is of an injective

5
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:26,884
linear transformation. So injective transformations send different

6
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:31,624
vectors to different places. So what that means is that if you take

7
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:36,624
two vectors from your domain, maybe v and we, and they are different vectors. So v

8
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:42,184
is not equal to w -- then T(v) is not equal to T(w).

9
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:47,624
They end up at a different place. They started out at different places. They end up at different places.

10
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:53,104
So that's what that property is called, either injective or one to one. So those two words

11
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:57,624
are going to be used interchangeably. The other definition

12
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:03,624
we want to talk about is what are called surjective linear transformations.

13
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:08,624
And here we want to think about transformations that fill up all of the codomain. So

14
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:13,624
in general, when you apply your map, T, your domain was

15
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:19,624
only going to be part of your code domain. So surjective maps are ones where

16
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:25,114
the image is actually the entire codomain. So in this case, we can

17
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:30,624
think about that in symbols as saying that the image of T is actually equal to all of W.

18
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,624
So the image of T is always going to be a subspace of W. But when you have a surjective

19
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:40,624
map, it's actually all of W. In following videos, we'll talk about

20
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:46,594
how to actually test if a given linear transformation is injective and or surjective

21
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:47,341
surgically.
