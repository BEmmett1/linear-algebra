00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:05,425
In this video, we're going to see how to use row operations to simplify a determinant

2
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:12,075
calculation, so to compute the determinant of this three by three matrix,

3
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:17,205
we might look at this. And notice that the first row is entirely divisible by

4
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:24,255
two. So you might think that dividing the first row by two is going to simplify our calculations.

5
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:29,895
So. Really, what we want to do is think about a multiplication

6
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:34,425
operation. That is going to encompass this.

7
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:42,755
So really, what we would like to do, I mean, just write the second row  the same here.

8
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:47,425
We want to think about dividing that first row by two or maybe another way to

9
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:53,335
to say that is factoring a two out of there so that we'd really like this to be a one, two

10
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:58,425
and three. Now, in order to make this the same as what we had before,

11
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:03,655
factoring that two out, really multiplying this by a matrix

12
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:09,065
that multiplies the first row by two.

13
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:15,425
I mean, quickly check that the product of these two matrices is the original one.

14
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:20,425
Now we know that the determinant of a product is a product of the determinants. So we can quickly compute the determinant

15
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:25,425
of our diagonal matrix over here, which we know to be two.

16
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:31,425
And this would be two times the determinant of the simplermatrix.

17
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:36,425
1 2 3;  1 0 3 and 0 3 4.

18
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:42,335
Now, as

19
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:47,425
you get more proficient at this, you won't need to write down this intermediate step every single time and just jump straight

20
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:53,045
from the first one to the third one where you factor that 2 out. But in this video, I wanted to write it down explicitly

21
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:58,225
so we can see exactly what's going on. Now, the next

22
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:03,595
thing we might want to try and do is look at this first column and see

23
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:08,665
that if we subtracted, say, the first row from the second row, then our first column

24
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:13,825
would just be a standard basis vector. So in this case,

25
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:18,875
we want to do the same kind of thing. And write this as a product

26
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:25,355
of two matrices.

27
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:31,085
And so the result, we want to leave the first row and the third row alone. 0

28
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:36,365
3 4 and we want to subtract that first row from the second

29
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:42,755
row, which would leave us with a zero and a negative two and zero.

30
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:48,785
So interpreting that as a matrix multiplication.

31
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:53,855
Let's see. To make these the same, we have to have a positive one here

32
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:59,425
as the inverse of that subtraction operation.

33
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:04,425
Now, the good news is this matrix. On the left has a determinant of one

34
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:11,425
because it's representing that shearing operation. So we just end up with two times the determinnt.

35
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:16,425
1 2 3 ; 0 -2 0; and 0 3 4

36
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:22,505
And again, as soon as you start doing

37
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:31,425
a few of these, you're gonna be skipping this intermediate step here. So.

38
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:36,425
In general, what we might try and do is write down determinant of

39
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:41,425
2 4 6; 1 0 3;  0 3 4.

40
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:47,425
We would factor that 2 out of the first row.

41
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:54,425
So we'd have 1 2 3; 1 0 3; 0 3 4.

42
00:03:54,425 --> 00:04:02,215
And then we would just do that row operation that we know does not alter the determinant.

43
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:07,965
First and third row are the same and we would have zero a negative two and

44
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:13,575
zero. So again, what's written in blue here is absolutely

45
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:18,425
OK. And then what we did in black was just kind of the very detailed

46
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,078
reasoning to go along with all that.
