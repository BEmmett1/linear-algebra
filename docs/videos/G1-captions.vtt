1
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:06,502
In this video, we're going to discuss how row operations affect

2
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:11,542
determinants of matrices. So remember, we have three different kinds of row operations, so we'll talk

3
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:16,152
about each of the three of them in turn. So the first kind of row operation we have is

4
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:21,802
multiplying a row by a scalar. So, for example, we might

5
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:26,152
multiply the second row by five, which I'll denote five row

6
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:32,062
two goes to row two. And as we talked about in module

7
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:37,902
M. You can represent this with matrix multiplication by multiplying

8
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:43,662
by matrix where we've done the same operation to the identity.

9
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:48,972
So here we've multiplied row 2 by 5. So I've just multiplied

10
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:54,542
to the identity matrix by five. If I take any Matrix A

11
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:59,552
and multiply Q1 times A, that will multiply to the second row

12
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:04,742
of A by five. Now think about how this affects the determinant. We want to think

13
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:09,152
about what's going on geometrically here. So

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:14,152
we're thinking in terms of transforming. In this case, if we're talking about R^3,

15
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:20,552
the unit cube and our basis vectors are going to go to the columns of

16
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:25,712
the new matrix. So our first one is going to go to 1 0 0

17
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:30,752
right where it was before our second one. So I'm going to go to 0 5 0 all the

18
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:35,152
way over here. Third one's going to go to 0 1 0. So now if I

19
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:42,482
complete this to a parallelepiped but in this case, it's rectangular.

20
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:50,152
We get this kind of beautiful shape.

21
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:55,152
Now, if we look at what those lengths are, in the X direction, we were length one

22
00:01:55,152 --> 00:02:00,152
in the Y direction, we were length five and in the Z direction we were length one. So our total

23
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:06,152
volume here is five. Therefore

24
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:12,152
the determinant of this Q1 matrix is five.

25
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:18,152
So in other words, if we apply this row operation to a matrix, we have

26
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:23,152
altered the determinant by a factor of five.

27
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:29,152
The second kind of row operation we had was swapping some rows. So, for example, maybe we'll swap

28
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:34,722
the second and third row of a matrix which I'll denote

29
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:40,152
like this. And if you want to write down the matrix, we multiply

30
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:45,552
by Q2 do this. Once again, we'll do the row operations to the identity

31
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:52,212
matrix. So we'll leave the first row, the identity matrix alone in the will swap the second and third rows.

32
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:58,152
But the third row in the second row and vise versa.

33
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:04,152
Once again, we want to think about what's happening geometrically.

34
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:09,152
I'm gonna use some different colors here to help us out. So our first column here, I'll do in

35
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:14,832
red. So our first basis vector 1 0 0. That stays at 1 0

36
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:20,122
0. Our second base is vector, which used to be zero one, zero

37
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:26,152
is now zero, zero one. So that's in the Z direction.

38
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:35,342
And finally, our third basis vector is now just going in the Y direction.

39
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:40,392
And so if we complete this. See that we get a cube

40
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:45,632
here. So our volume is going to be 1 times 1

41
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:51,152
times 1, which is still 1. However, the determinant

42
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:56,252
is not going to be 1. Remember, our determinant is actually a

43
00:03:56,252 --> 00:04:01,382
signed volume, not just the volume, and what the sign is telling us is if we have a

44
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:06,152
left handed or right handed coordinate system. And in this case, what we've done is we've

45
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:12,962
actually changed the handedness of our coordinate system by swapping those two rows.

46
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:17,152
So here we have our basis vectors in order. So we had

47
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:23,102
red first and then blue and then green. So in a right handed coordinate system, if we do the

48
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:28,862
right hand rule on the red and the blue, we should end up with the positive green direction.

49
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:34,022
But here we see if we curl our fingers from the red to the blue with our right hand,

50
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:39,152
our thumb will be pointing off to the left, which is the negative green direction. So therefore, we've

51
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:44,152
changed our handedness here, so the determinant of Q2

52
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:50,152
is actually negative 1. And in general what will

53
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:55,232
happen hear is if you swap any pair of rows, that will alter the determinant by one negative

54
00:04:55,232 --> 00:05:00,602
sign. So if you do a whole bunch of swaps, you just have to count as you do an even number or an odd number

55
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:06,152
to determine if the determinant is positive one or negative.

56
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:11,782
The last kind of cooperation we have was a kind of shearing operation.

57
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:17,542
So we might add a multiple of one row to another row. So here I've

58
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:22,672
written down, we're going to add two row twos to row three. So

59
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:27,742
with matrix multiplication, we would multiply on the left by the following matrix in a

60
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:32,152
row 1 in row two alone. We're going to add two row twos to row 3

61
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:37,942
here. Now I'll attempt

62
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:43,962
to draw this picture. It is not quite as

63
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:49,292
easy to draw as the other ones, but I'll do my best. So our first basis

64
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:54,342
vector still 1 0 0. Our second one is actually changing. In our third

65
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:59,412
one is the same. So our third one is going up here 0 0

66
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:04,792
1. And then our second basis vector is going

67
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:13,152
on in the Y direction and 2 in this direction, so we're going to.

68
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:19,182
Let's see, I drew that one incorrectly because that only went up 1 in the Y direction,

69
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:28,972
one in the Z direction, sorry. Let's try that again to go up.

70
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:33,152
To to direction.

71
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:39,152
All right. So now we'll complete this complete this over to a paralleliped

72
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:46,142
so we could go up one further out this way.

73
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:54,942
Down.

74
00:06:54,942 --> 00:07:00,322
All right, so this picture is a little bit messy, but maybe what I'm seeing here is that in the XY plane we have a unit

75
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:05,452
square so that we can think about that as our our base and that unit squares can be from

76
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:10,522
the X and the Z here. And then we have another unit square over for the

77
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:15,532
top over here. So the the left side and the right side of our

78
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:20,552
figure are unit squares, which we can treat as our base.

79
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:25,912
And then we multiply that by the height. In this case, our height is going left to right. So

80
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:30,982
you have one for the area of our unit square. Height is that distance, one to the right.

81
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:36,152
So our volume here is just one. So our determinant of.

82
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:41,152
This matrix is one, and this is going to hold for any kind

83
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:47,342
of a shearing operation like this where you just taken a unit cube and sheared it. In this case, we sheared

84
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,440
it up a little bit in the Z direction.
