1
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:14,204
So here I have a set of three vectors written down. And our question of if they are linearly dependent or not.

2
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:19,144
It's really a question of can we build one of these three vectors out of the other two?

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:26,854
So note that another way of saying that is how many ways do we have to build the zero vector out of these vectors?

4
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:34,854
So. How many solutions

5
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:46,854
Does the vector equation say x1 times the first one [2,1,-1] plus x2 times the second one [3,1,4]

6
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:51,854
plux x3 times the third one [1,1,-6]

7
00:00:51,854 --> 00:01:03,854
How many ways can we produce the zero vector here? So note that whenever we have a nontrivial solution here.

8
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:07,854
So the trivial solution would be x1, x2, and x3 all zero.

9
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:15,444
So we can always build a zero vector that way. But if I can do this with one of these X one, X two, X three being non zero,

10
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:20,854
then I can rearrange this and solve for one of these vectors in terms of being built out of the other ones.

11
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:27,204
So if we only have the trivial solution, then these vectors are linearly independent, if we have a non-trivial solution then

12
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:33,854
These vectors linearly dependent. So now we have a vector equation that we can solve.

13
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:43,854
So we'll write down our augmented matrix to go along with this system.

14
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:53,854
All right.

15
00:01:53,854 --> 00:02:00,854
To figure out how many solutions we have, we'll compute the reduced row echelon form of this matrix.

16
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:13,854
So I have gone ahead and typed this into Wolfram Alpha ahead of time, one zero two zero zero one negative one.

17
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:20,924
And that last row is zero zero zero zero.

18
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:28,964
All right. So, as I said, we always have a solution, the question is if we have one solution or if we have infinitely many solutions.

19
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:36,264
And the key thing that's going to tell us how many solutions we have is whether we have any free variables or not,

20
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:39,164
where we have a free variable that's going to correspond with infinitely many

21
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:44,894
solutions because that free variable could take on any real number value.

22
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:51,054
So when I look in here, I see this non pivot column right here.

23
00:02:51,054 --> 00:03:09,534
That's going to give us a free variable. And we know that free variable is going to correspond to infinitely many solutions.

24
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:14,854
So in particular, if I have infinitely many solutions, I have non-trivial solutions.

25
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:28,864
If I have nontrivial solutions so infinitely many nontrivial solutions.

26
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:32,914
That means I'm gonna have one where one of these three terms is not zero,

27
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:37,234
and then I'll be able to solve for that vector in terms of the other ones or actually many not

28
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:44,854
trivial solutions tells us that we can build one of these three vectors out of the other two.

29
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:47,176
So they are linearly dependent.
