00:00:00,658 --> 00:00:05,098
In this video, we are going to learn how to find a basis for the image of a linear

2
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:10,098
transformation.  So as a reminder, the image is the subspace given by

3
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:16,238
all the things in the codomain that are mapped to by something in the domain.

4
00:00:16,238 --> 00:00:21,648
So to figure out what all of those things are, we just need to remember that everything in the domain

5
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:26,098
can be built out of the basis vectors for our domain. Therefore,

6
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:32,268
everything in the image can be built out of the images of those basis vectors.

7
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:37,788
So formally we would say that our image then is given

8
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:43,098
by the span of the images of our bases vectors. So

9
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:48,098
T of e1, T of e2, T of e3

10
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:57,528
and T of e4.

11
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:02,098
And the good news is, because we are handed a standard matrix

12
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:08,098
of our map T, we know exactly what

13
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:13,748
those vectors. T of e1, T of e2, T of e3, T of e4 are. Those are the columns

14
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:18,098
of our standard matrix. So we simply need to find

15
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:31,098
a basis of the subspace spann by these four vectors.

16
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:37,098
And our last one is negative four, one,

17
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:42,448
negative four. All

18
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:47,098
right, so we've reduced our problem for finding the basis or a basis of the image of T

19
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:53,128
into finding a basis of a subspace spanned by these four vectors,

20
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:58,258
which is precisely a V7 problem which we've learned how to do

21
00:01:58,258 --> 00:02:03,358
previously. But we'll go through the steps here. So what we'll want to do is we want

22
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:09,098
to find the reduced row echelon form of this matrix.

23
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:16,098
So I've gone ahead and typed  that into calculator to produce this.

24
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:21,888
In this case, we've got 1 2 0 0; 0 0 1 0

25
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:29,098
in our last row is 0 0 0 1.

26
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:35,428
So now what we're looking for here are the pivot columns.

27
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:40,498
Remember, if I have a non pivot column that's telling us that we can build that vector out of

28
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:45,628
the pivot columns that came previously, for example, that second column there, the 2 0

29
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:50,938
0 that's telling us that that is exactly two times the first column, which we can see

30
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:56,188
by inspection. So now we know that those three pivot

31
00:02:56,188 --> 00:03:01,798
columns are going to span the same subspace. But now they're going to be linearly independent.

32
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:06,908
So therefore, we have a basis of the image, a basis

33
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:12,098
of image of T is

34
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:17,098
simply the set containing those three vectors.  2 -2 3;

35
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:23,098
Skip the second one, probably close our bracket.

36
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:29,098
Third one 2 1 -1; and the fourth one

37
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:36,848
-4 1 -4

38
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:42,098
So that is how we find the basis of the image of a linear transformation. Basically

39
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:47,138
reduce it to a V7 problem and go from there. In the next

40
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:52,591
video, we'll talk about how to find a basis of the kernel of a linear transformation.
