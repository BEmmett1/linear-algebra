00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:07,862
In this video, we're going to see how to determine when a set of vectors spans all of Euclidean space or not.

2
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:17,862
So in this particular example, I've got four vectors in R^3 here, and we want to know if they span all of R^3 or just a smaller subspace.

3
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:22,862
So the first thing to do is to unpack our definition of spanning.

4
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:30,862
So when we say it spans all of R^3, what we mean there is that we can build anything in R^3 out of these four vectors.

5
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:40,862
So in other words, I want to think about building things--so I'll take these vectors, multiply them by some scalars--which we don't necessarily know,

6
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:47,862
so I'll use variables x_1--and we can add them or scalar multiplication.

7
00:00:47,862 --> 00:00:53,862
So x_2 times the second one and x_3 times the third one.

8
00:00:53,862 --> 00:01:02,732
[1 1 -6] and x_4 times the fourth one.

9
00:01:02,732 --> 00:01:07,862
All right. So this represents the things we can build out of these four vectors.

10
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:17,862
And our question is, can we build everything in R^3 out of these vectors? So can I write down some arbitrary b here?

11
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:24,862
And the question is. Does this have a solution

12
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:42,862
For every b in R^3? All right.

13
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:46,862
So how might we answer that? The idea is we don't know what that b is,

14
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:54,392
but we can still look at the left hand side of this system and try and deduce if we're always going to have a solution.

15
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:58,352
So what we'll do is we'll look at the matrix that goes with the left hand side of

16
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:04,322
the system here and think about what would happen if we augmented with something.

17
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:10,682
So I'm not going to write down an augmented thing. Because that would just be a bunch of variables that we don't know.

18
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:16,862
All right, hand the left hand side of this system here or this vector equation.

19
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:23,832
Which looks like this. All right, and if we did have a particular b,,

20
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:31,862
we would augment with this and we would find the reduced row echelon form to find a simpler system to determine if we would always have a solution.

21
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:36,862
So we can go ahead and compute the RREF of the left side here.

22
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:46,332
I typed this into Wolfram Alpha or expedience. And this produces the following.

23
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:59,862
Simpler matrix. So now what we want to think about is what would happen if we augmented this one on the left.

24
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:04,492
So that would be if we chose a particular b and put it in there.

25
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:09,622
So there's really only one thing that could go wrong and produce a inconsistent system here

26
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:16,372
is that if we end up on the right hand side with a row that says zero is equal to one.

27
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:19,862
So the first row is never gonna produce that. The second row is never going to produce that.

28
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:23,862
Our third row, because we have zeros over here in the third row.

29
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:34,862
It's possible that for some choice of b we're going to end up with one in the bottom spot and that's going to produce an inconsistent system.

30
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:54,687
So -- let me change colors here--so this bottom row is really what's flagging this as a problem for us.

31
00:03:54,687 --> 00:04:00,687
for some b in R^3.

32
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,687
And we don't need to know exactly what that b is here.

33
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:10,687
We just need to know that there's some thing in R^3 that we can't build out of these four vectors.

34
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:16,687
So the answer to our question in blue is no. There is some b where we end up with an inconsistent system.

35
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:21,687
So the answer to our original question is also no, these vectors do not span R^3.=

36
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:26,997
because there is some vector in R^3 that we cannot build out of those four vectors.
