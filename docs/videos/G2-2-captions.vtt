1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:05,747
In this video, we're going to practice computing the determinant of a four by four matrix.

2
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:10,797
So bring down a four by four matrix here that we want to get the determiner. And when I look at this

3
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:16,617
matrix, I see that the second column is kind of very inviting here

4
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:21,717
because it has a couple zeros in it. And we know that if we get it a standard

5
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:27,087
basis vector in a column, then we can reduce the dimension and make our life easier.

6
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:32,097
So the first thing I'm going to want to do here is try and turn one of those ones into a zero. So what

7
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:37,227
I might do is I might subtract the first row from the third row,

8
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:42,677
which we know does not change the determinant right down.

9
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:48,477
First, second and fourth rose the same.

10
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:53,817
And now we'll take negative are the first row added to the third row. It's a negative two

11
00:00:53,817 --> 00:01:03,197
and a zero and a negative one negative six.

12
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:08,267
Now, we can't quite reduce the dimension here because we have our first base factor in our second

13
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:13,397
spot. That's OK. We can swap the first two columns in

14
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:18,677
a column swap. We know alters the determined by a minus sign because it changes is from a right hand accordance system

15
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:23,717
to a Latin accordian system or vise versa. We'll go ahead and

16
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:29,127
swap those two columns. So, you know, it's a negative

17
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:34,127
to me. Seconds third spot in a

18
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:39,337
positive tone in the second spots. And then our

19
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:47,987
third and fourth columns stay the same.

20
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:53,257
Right now that we have the first standard basis vector in the first column, we can reduce

21
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:58,347
the dimension here. So this would be the same

22
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:04,357
thing. As still haven't negative sign out front, determinate

23
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:09,487
three by three, matrix 2 4 to. Negative 2, negative

24
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:16,497
1 6 1 3 5.

25
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:21,507
Now, when I look at this, I notice that everything in the first row is divisible by two. So you go ahead and

26
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:26,997
factor that out. We have negative two times that determinate 1

27
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:32,307
to 1 negative 2 negative 1 negative 6

28
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:37,567
1 3 5.

29
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:42,627
At this point, I'll mention that there's lots of different ways to compute the determinate of a three by three matrix. Feel free

30
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:49,037
to use your favorite one. I'm going to use my favorite one, which is just continue what we've been doing.

31
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:54,257
Unfortunately, I don't see a whole bunch of zeros anywhere, but I do have a one up in the top

32
00:02:54,257 --> 00:03:05,427
left and I can use it to make zeros below it.

33
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:10,997
So in particular. Copy down that top row

34
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:15,997
of one to one. I had two times the top row to the second row. That'll

35
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:21,457
make a zero here. We'll have a three and a negative four.

36
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:26,897
And if I subtract the top row from the third row, then I'll give me a zero and then a one

37
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:32,027
and a four. Now, once again, we got the first big

38
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:37,457
standard basis vector in the first spot. So we can

39
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:44,147
reduce the dimension once or. Negative two times that a terminal.

40
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:50,447
To my teachings.

41
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:55,757
Again, there's several different ways that we could compute this two by two determinant.

42
00:03:55,757 --> 00:04:00,827
I think what I usually do is simply take the product of the diagonal and subtract off the

43
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:06,677
product of the anti diagonal. In other words, we'll do three times for we'll subtract off

44
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:11,897
1 times negative four and negative two

45
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:18,437
times twelve plus four, negative two times sixteen.

46
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:23,897
So our determinant of our matrix is negative thirty two.

47
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:28,967
So again, there's lots of different routes you can take. This is just one particular way that we

48
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,102
could do this.
