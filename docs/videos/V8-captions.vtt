00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:10,181
In this video, we're going to see how to answer some of these questions about vector spaces such as vector spaces of polynomials and matrices.

2
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:17,181
So here I've got a question about polynomials, namely, are these three polynomials linearly independent.

3
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:21,811
So we approach this in the exact same way as we did for the vectors.

4
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:28,181
We want to know how many ways there are to build the zero polynomial out of these three polynomials,

5
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:39,181
In particular we want to know, is there a non-trivial solution? So is there a non-trivial.

6
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:46,181
Solution to -- I'm not going to use X variables here because we have all these X's floating around,

7
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:54,181
I'll say y1 times 2x^2+x-1 plus y2 times the second one.

8
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:59,181
3x^2+x+4

9
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:05,181
And say y3 times x^+x-6

10
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:13,141
Is there are nontrivial way to build a zero polynomial out of these three?

11
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:19,371
So to answer this, we want to figure out if the polynomial on the left is equal to the polynomial on the right.

12
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:25,021
The zero polynomial over there. And two polynomials are equal exactly when all their coefficients are equal.

13
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:30,301
So let's go ahead and rewrite what's on the left, but group the things by coefficients.

14
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,181
So we can think about expanding out,

15
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:40,181
multiplying y1 times each of these terms y2 times each of these terms, and y3 times each of these terms and then grouping by the coefficients.

16
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:47,181
So I'll go ahead and do that in one step for efficiency. So for x^2 we'll get a 2y1 here.

17
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:57,181
From the middle term, we'll have a 3y2, and from the last term we'll just have a y3.

18
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:03,181
So those are the only terms that have an x^2 in them. For the x's,  we'll have a y1 from the first one.

19
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:11,181
A y2 from the second one. And looks like plusy3 from the third one.

20
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:21,451
And finally, for the constant terms, we have a negative y1 plus 4y2 and minus 6y3.

21
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:27,181
And we want to think about solutions of producing the zero polynomial.

22
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:32,191
So the only way that could be zero is if this first coefficient is zero. The second coefficient is zero.

23
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:37,181
And that third coefficient is zero. So we need these three things to happen simultaneously.

24
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:38,181
2y1+3y2+y3 needs to be zero.

25
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:54,181
y1+y2+y3 needs to be zero and -y1+4y2-6y3.

26
00:02:54,181 --> 00:03:03,181
Also needs to be zero. Now we have a system of equations and we're asking ourselves how many solutions this system has.

27
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:20,181
So we can write down the corresponding augmented matrix here. Two three one zero one one one zero and negative one, positive four, negative six and zero.

28
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:26,481
So to answer that, just like we have been doing, will compute the reduced row echelon form.

29
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:31,391
I typed this into Wolfram Alpha in advance for expediency.

30
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:39,181
And this produces one zero two. Zero zero one negative.

31
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:45,181
One zero. And finally, the bottom row is all zeroes.

32
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:50,181
All right.

33
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:57,181
So our question was, is there a nontrivial solution? So we'll always have the trivial solution with y1, y2, and y3 all zero.

34
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:01,181
But here I see this third column here

35
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:14,181
is a non pivot column. Which means we'll have a free variable.

36
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:25,181
And if we have a free variable, that means we have infinitely many solutions. So we have infinitely many

37
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:36,181
Nontrivial solutions. Right, there's only one trivial solution, so they have infinitely many solutions.

38
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:41,751
All but one of those infinitely many things are non trivial solutions.

39
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:48,551
So we have nontrivial solutions. So the answer to this question is.

40
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:57,181
Yes. Is there a nontrivial solution? So that means that our polynomials are linearly dependent.

41
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:03,271
No. They are linearly dependent.

42
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:09,458
We can build that third one out of the first two.
