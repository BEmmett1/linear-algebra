00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:07,464
In this video, we're going to see how to interpret  row operations as matrix multiplication.

2
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:13,474
The first thing to remember is that matrix multiplication is composition of linear maps.

3
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:21,464
So we really want to think about this in terms of linear transformations. So let's look at this first question first.

4
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:30,784
Give a four by four matrix that can be used to perform the row operation. The third row goes to the third row plus four times the first row.

5
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:37,804
So want to think about the linear transformation that goes along with this matrix?

6
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:44,464
So we don't know what it looks like yet, but we're gonna take something that looks like the identity matrix and tweak it slightly to make it work.

7
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:50,944
So for the moment, let's just suppose we had the identity matrix and then we'll come back and change this.

8
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,874
Once we figure out how we need to change this to make it work.

9
00:00:55,874 --> 00:01:00,464
So I'll write down the identity matrix here. All right.

10
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:13,424
So what does this do to a vector in R^4? Let me just write down kind of arbitrary vector and our four x one x two x three x four

11
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:19,364
All right, so we apply linear transformation to a vector. Remember, we're doing linear combinations of the columns here.

12
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:29,594
So this is X1 Times, the first column, which is one zero zero zero plus X, two times the second column.

13
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:38,554
Zero one zero zero. Well, it's X three times the third column.

14
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:49,924
And plus X four times. All right.

15
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:57,344
And if we just do this as it's written, then we end up with X one, x two, x three, x four.

16
00:01:57,344 --> 00:02:03,284
It's not surprising the identity matrix left this thing alone.

17
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:07,514
OK. But that's not exactly what we're after, right? We want to send the third row to the third row.

18
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:13,464
Plus four times the first row. So it's kind of work a little bit backwards here.

19
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:25,964
Instead of this vector x1 x2 x3 x4 we really want to end up with X three plus four times X1.

20
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:31,677
So four times the first row added to third.

21
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:41,607
So if we want to get to x one in the third spot, the only way we're gonna get an X one is to change what's going on with our first vector.

22
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:46,227
Because that is the only place we see an X one, we want to see it. And the third row.

23
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:55,397
So we have to change the third row here from a zero solar arrays that zero.

24
00:02:55,397 --> 00:03:07,067
And so instead of just getting X one times one zero zero zero, we will explain times one zero four there instead of zero.

25
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:19,560
So now we go back and change our standard matrix to reflect this, we left.

26
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
So now this matrix goes with our linear map here.

27
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:33,560
It took the vector x1 x2 x3 x4 and send it to x1 x2 x3+4x1 x4

28
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:41,820
All right. So this does the trick for the first one. Now let's think about what if we're going to swap a couple rows.

29
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,850
So let's let it go. How about. S going from R for an.

30
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:53,760
R for. The linear transformation.

31
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:02,670
With Standard Matrix Q We're gonna tackle this and kind of exactly the same way for the moment, we'll say.

32
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:13,560
Q Is the identity matrix? And then we will kind of work through to the end and then work backwards.

33
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:23,560
All right. So what should S of X one X two X three X form look like?

34
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Just like before, because for the moment. Q is the identity matrix

35
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Just have x1 times the first standard basis vector, x2 times the second standard basis vector and should be a one.

36
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:57,560
x three times the third one. Plus X, four times the last one.

37
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,260
And once again, if we leave Q as the identity matrix will get X one, x two, x three x four.

38
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,270
But that's not what we want again. We want to have the second and the fourth one swapped.

39
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:20,320
So X one, an X three should be the same. But instead of X two, we really want to X four and we really want the next two year.

40
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,840
So now we have to fix our part over here to make sure that we end up with X1 X for X three x two here and now,

41
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,330
the idea is we basically swap the roles of X two and X four.

42
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:42,220
Right. We really want to get X four multiplied by zero one zero zero and X two multiplied by

43
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,560
zero zero zero one because it would put X two in the bottom spot in X four in this one.

44
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Maybe I'll just come here and cross that out and put an X four and cross that out.

45
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:06,490
Now, before we go back and fix Q I'm going to write this again, but put the variables in.

46
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:15,980
The correct order now, so X two is now multiplied by zero zero zero one.

47
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:30,636
And X three is still multiplied by zero zero one zero.

48
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:33,776
All right, so now we'll go back up to our Matrix Cube X,

49
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:42,496
what is still multiply by one zero zero zero, but our second column should now be that's not an A.

50
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:47,496
The second column should now be zero zero one zero.

51
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:57,496
Once again, erasing is not working -- there we go. You can erase this column.

52
00:06:57,496 --> 00:07:04,816
And add in zero zero zero one third column, zero zero one zero.

53
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:17,886
That stayed the same. But our fourth column changed here. It's a race that.

54
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:25,496
It's. And now our fourth column should be zero one zero.

55
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:29,496
Zero. What's going on down here?

56
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:40,496
So now this matrix Q lines up with our linear transformation with the blue corrections that swaps the second and fourth rows.

57
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:45,496
All right. So that's two of our three row operations. We have one more kind row operation.

58
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:53,699
So let me clear as a little bit of space here.

59
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:59,249
All right, so now let's find linear transformation that goes with our standard matrix B,

60
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:03,629
which again, just for the moment I put in the identity matrix is a placeholder.

61
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:12,959
And we'll correct that in just a second. Want to see what happens to X1 X two, x three, x four.

62
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:43,129
So for the moment this is going to X one. That was the first database's vector, just like for.

63
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,709
All right, so if we compute, this will get X one, x two, x three,

64
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,909
x4 because that's what the identity matrix does for the identity linear transformation.

65
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:57,589
It leaves things alone. What we really want to get instead is we want our second row to be multiplied by negative five.

66
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:03,209
So instead of X two, we want a negative five x two.

67
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:08,189
And then X three and X four. All right.

68
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:12,029
So instead of next to here, we want a negative five x two.

69
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:17,929
So we're going to look over here where we produced an X to add.

70
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,479
Instead of getting X two times one, we want X two times negative five.

71
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,519
So instead of the one, we really want to have a negative five.

72
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:34,219
And now we do this, we'll get zero negative five x two zero zero added to the other things which remain the same.

73
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:40,609
So to fix this, we need to go back to our standard matrix and make the second column look like this column now.

74
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:46,387
We only changed one component there. Go ahead and race this.

75
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:54,677
So we'll go ahead and fix this second column. So we should have zero negative five zero zero.

76
00:09:54,677 --> 00:10:02,777
And now this Matrix B will correspond to our linear transformation that sends Rotu to negative five to.
