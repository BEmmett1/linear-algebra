00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:07,410
In this video, we're going to see how to solve a system of linear equations, including writing the solution set in set builder notation.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:15,410
So here we have three equations in three variables. And the very first thing we want to do is write down the corresponding augmented matrix.

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:24,410
So our first row looks like two, minus one, one, and that seven to the right of the bar. Then three,

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,410
Negative two, zero, eleven.

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:37,410
And then I only have five, zero, 10. And the fifteen.

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,410
Now we want to pop over to my favorite RREF calculator--in this case, Wolfram Alpha.

7
00:00:44,410 --> 00:01:11,410
And find the reduced row echelon form here. And now that I have it reduced row echelon form, I'll go ahead and circle pivots.

8
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:22,410
And then I'm going to rewrite this as a nice, simple system of equations. So that first row looks like x1 plus two x3, equal to three.

9
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,410
Second row looks like x2 plus three x3.

10
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,612
equals negative one. Now, there, row three says zero equals zero.

11
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:41,482
Now, I want to highlight here. Well, we have exactly one column that was not a pivot.

12
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:48,612
So each of our non pivot columns is going to correspond to a free variable so we can let X three be our favorite letter.

13
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:53,352
I usually start with a and that's gonna be our free variable.

14
00:01:53,352 --> 00:02:01,612
One non pivot column here means one free variable. And now we can rewrite our system of equations using this free variable.

15
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:10,742
So an A instead of X three. x2 plus 3a can still be a negative one.

16
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:17,612
And now the beauty of the reduced row echelon form is that it's very easy to solve for our pivot variables X1 and X2 here.

17
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:35,081
So we have X one equal to three minus two a;  x2 is negative one minus three a.

18
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:56,983
Simply write down a vector, so X1 was three minus two a, x two is negative one, minus three a.
