00:00:00,577 --> 00:00:08,317
In this video, we're going to see how to show that a transformation between vector spaces is a linear transformation.

2
00:00:08,317 --> 00:00:13,717
So here I have transformation between the space of polynomial to the space of polynomials,

3
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:22,447
where it takes a polynomial, it spits back X squared times polynomial plus three times polynomial evaluated at zero.

4
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:26,827
To show this is linear, we need to check two things. We need a check that respects addition.

5
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:32,277
We need a check that respects scalar multiplication. So let's do additions first.

6
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:37,117
So we need to take two polynomials. We want to check if we add them and then apply.

7
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:41,467
S if that's the same thing as applying s to each of them.

8
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:53,037
And then adding them. So we need to compute both of these things and see that they are the same.

9
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:59,817
So let's start with S of f plus g. So by definition, as says, we're going to take this thing f plus g

10
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:06,037
We're going to multiply it by X squared.

11
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:14,037
And then we're going to add three times that function evaluated at zero -- f plus g, evaluated at zero is just f of zero.

12
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:23,887
Plus g of  zero. So we've got X squared  f of X plus X squared g of X.

13
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:30,037
Plus three zero plus three here.

14
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:42,507
Now to compute S(f)+S(g). We'll do S(f) which is just X squared F of X plus three F of zero.

15
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:50,037
And then as of G is gonna be X squared G of X plus three G and zero.

16
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:57,037
And these are written in a different order, but it's clear that they're the same thing. So we conclude that S respects addition.

17
00:01:57,037 --> 00:02:06,037
Now we need to check that S respects scalar multiplication. So we're gonna take a scalar C and look at S of C f.

18
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:12,037
So that's multiplying by C and then applying S or applying S first.

19
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:17,037
And then multiplying by C. So we need to compute both of these.

20
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:27,207
So starting with the first one S of C fof X will take X squared and multiply that by our function C, F of X.

21
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:34,777
And then add three times so many times the function evaluated at zero.

22
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:44,317
So we've got one C X squared of X plus three C from zero.

23
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:49,037
And now for the second part, we're just going to compute as of F and multiply it by C.

24
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:57,033
So that's X squared f of X. Plus three f of zero.

25
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:03,033
So we have c X squared f of X plus three, C f of zero.

26
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:11,113
And sure enough, those are the same thing. So our map as respects addition respects scalar multiplication.

27
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,604
Therefore, it is a linear transformation.
