1
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:15,808
So here, I've written down an example--W is a subset of R^4 defined by this equation, 2x+3y=4z-5w

2
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:24,808
So we have two things to check: the first thing we want to ask is is W closed under addition.

3
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:32,808
And in a moment, we'll check if it's closed under scalar multiplication. So what does it mean to be closed under addition?

4
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:40,808
Well, we want to take two things in W. Maybe I'll call them x1,y1,z1,w1

5
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:48,808
And the second one can be x2,y2,z2,w2.

6
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:55,808
So let those be elements of W. So what it means to be closedunder addition is that when we add them together

7
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:15,468
we stay in W. We start with two things in W, add them together and we'll see if we stay in W.

8
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:20,808
If that happens, no matter what these two vectors are, then we say W is closed under addition.

9
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:30,688
All right. So how do we check this? Well, the way we check things are in W is we see if they satisfy this equation up here.

10
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,808
So we go ahead and add these two vectors together.

11
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:46,728
And this is kind of boring, we just get x1+x2, y1+y2, z1+z2, w1+w2

12
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:51,438
So now you want to know if we take two times the X component plus three times the Y component.

13
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,808
Do we get four times the Z component, minus five times the W component?

14
00:01:55,808 --> 00:02:03,808
Let me write that down--two times the X component is 2(x1+x2)plus three times the Y component (y1+y2)

15
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:11,808
is equal to four times the Z component.

16
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:24,808
minus five times the w. Now, these aren't just any two vectors in R^4, these vectors came from W.

17
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:31,808
So that tells us something about x1,y1,z1,w1, and x2,y2,z2,w2

18
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:38,808
in particular, because this first vector is in W we know these components also satisfy this equation.

19
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:49,808
So since these are in W we have 2x1+3y1 one better be equal 4z1-5w1

20
00:02:49,808 --> 00:03:02,808
And similarly, because our second vector here is an element of W that exactly means that 2x2+3y2 is equal to 4z2-5w2

21
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:10,808
And this is all the information we need to answer this question over here.

22
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:18,808
In particular, we do a little bit of arithmetic. You notice we have 2x1 plus 2x2

23
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:27,808
And if we distribute this 3y1+3y2. And on the right side 4z1+4z2

24
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:36,808
minus 5w1 minus 5 w2. Now, we look at the terms here.

25
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:41,808
I see a 2x1 and a 3y1

26
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:48,808
So go ahead and write that together. 2x1+3y1

27
00:03:48,808 --> 00:04:00,808
If I look on the right hand side, I also see a 4z1 minus 5w1 -- we've got 4z1-5w1

28
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:05,808
Similarly I can group all the ones with with twos as subscripts together.

29
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:21,808
So I got a 2x2, and 3y2. All right, that is 2x2+3y2

30
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:30,808
And then finally, for the last two terms, we have plus 4z2-5w2.

31
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:41,068
Now, the key thing to note is that the terms in red are exactly our first equation over here.

32
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,878
And the terms in green are exactly our second equation over there.

33
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:48,808
So because the red parts are equal and the green parts are equal, when I add them together.

34
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:52,808
This is actually a true statement.

35
00:04:52,808 --> 00:05:06,558
So we have shown that, yes. Two times the X component plus three times the Y component equals four times the Z component, minus five times the W component.

36
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:11,808
Therefore, the sum of these two vectors is still in W.

37
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:17,648
So therefore, W is closed under addition. All right.

38
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:22,218
We're halfway done. We need to check if W is closed under scalar multiplication.

39
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:36,808
Now. So this works similarly.

40
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:44,808
We're gonna take a vector in W and a scalar c and we're going to multiply them together and see if the result stays in W.

41
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:52,808
So let's let. We can use the same vector here, x1, y1, z1, w1.

42
00:05:52,808 --> 00:06:01,808
and we'll pick a scalar--I usually use c, but you can use whatever letter you like--from R.

43
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:11,808
And the question is when I multiply this. If we stay in W.

44
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:21,808
And note that to multiply, we just simply multiply, cx1, cy1, cz1, cw1

45
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:28,808
So to check if this is in W we check ifthis vector down here satisfies that equation.

46
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:40,808
So it's two times the first component. Plus three times the second component equal to four times the third component.

47
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:48,808
Minus five times the last component. Now, what do we have to work with?

48
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:54,808
We know this vector x1, z1, y1, w1 came from W.

49
00:06:54,808 --> 00:07:05,428
That tells us that 2x1+3y1=4z1-5w1

50
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:10,808
So we know that's true. Now, if we come over here, we can do arithmetic as before and expand this out.

51
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:15,808
We have 2cx1+3cy1

52
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:26,808
And we want to know, is this equal to--oops, sorry, these should be cz1 and cw1 back up here-- 4cz1-5cw1.

53
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:40,808
Now, I can factor a c out here on the left hand side and then I have c (2x1+3y1)

54
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:45,808
And we're still wanting to know if this is equal to 4cz1-5cw1.

55
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:57,808
But I know 2x1+3y1 has to be equal to 4z1-5w1 since this vector came from W.

56
00:07:57,808 --> 00:08:03,808
So this is equal to c times 4z1-5w1

57
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:11,118
And we're still asking is this equal to 4cz1-5cw1

58
00:08:11,118 --> 00:08:14,808
Now we can see that yes, these two things actually are equal.

59
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:22,808
So the answer to our question is yes, which tells us the answer to our question is c times thisvector in W.

60
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:31,268
Yes. Which was a rephrasing of our question is W closed under scalar multiplication.

61
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:34,808
So W is closed, under addition is closed and scalar multiplication.

62
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:41,423
Therefore, this thing is a subspace of R^4.
