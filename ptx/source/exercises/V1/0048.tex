\begin{exerciseStatement}


 Let \(V\) be the set of all pairs \((x,y)\) of real numbers together with the following operations: 


\begin{align*} (x_1,y_1)\oplus (x_2,y_2)&= \left(2 \, x_{1} x_{2},\,y_{1} + 4 \, y_{2}\right)  \\c \odot (x,y) &= \left(c x,\,0\right) . \\ \end{align*}
            

 (a) Show that there exists an additive identity element, that is: 

\[\text{There exists }(w,z)\in V\text{ such that }(x,y)\oplus(w,z)=(x,y).
    \]

 (b) Explain why \(V\) nonetheless is not a vector space. 


\end{exerciseStatement}
    
\begin{exerciseAnswer} 


\(V\) is not a vector space, which may be shown by demonstrating that any one of the following properties do not hold: 


\begin{itemize}
\item vector addition is not associative
\item vector addition is not commutative
\item additive inverses do not always exist
\item 1 is not a scalar multiplication identity
\item scalar multiplication does not distribute over vector addition
\item scalar multiplication does not distribute over scalar addition
\end{itemize}
