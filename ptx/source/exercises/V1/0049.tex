\begin{exerciseStatement}


 Let \(V\) be the set of all pairs \((x,y)\) of real numbers together with the following operations: 


\begin{align*} (x_1,y_1)\oplus (x_2,y_2)&= \left(x_{1} + x_{2},\,y_{1} + y_{2}\right)  \\c \odot (x,y) &= \left(c x,\,c y - 7 \, c + 7\right) . \\ \end{align*}
            

 (a) Show that scalar multiplication is associative, that is: 

\[a\odot(b\odot (x,y))=(ab)\odot(x,y).
    \]

 (b) Explain why \(V\) nonetheless is not a vector space. 


\end{exerciseStatement}
    
\begin{exerciseAnswer} 


\(V\) is not a vector space, which may be shown by demonstrating that any one of the following properties do not hold: 


\begin{itemize}
\item scalar multiplication does not distribute over vector addition
\item scalar multiplication does not distribute over scalar addition
\end{itemize}
