    <p> Let <span class="math">\(V\)</span> be the set of all pairs <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> of real numbers together with the following operations: </p>
    <p class="math">\begin{align*} (x_1,y_1)\oplus (x_2,y_2)&amp;= \left(2 \, x_{1} x_{2},\,y_{1} + 2 \, y_{2}\right)  \\c \odot (x,y) &amp;= \left(c x,\,0\right) . \\ \end{align*}</p>
    <p> (a) Show that there exists an additive identity element, that is: </p>
    <p class="math">\[\text{There exists }(w,z)\in V\text{ such that }(x,y)\oplus(w,z)=(x,y).

      <b>Answer:</b>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math">\(V\)</span> is not a vector space, which may be shown by demonstrating that any one of the following properties do not hold: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>vector addition is not associative</li>
      <li>vector addition is not commutative</li>
      <li>additive inverses do not always exist</li>
      <li>1 is not a scalar multiplication identity</li>
      <li>scalar multiplication does not distribute over vector addition</li>
      <li>scalar multiplication does not distribute over scalar addition</li>
    </ul>
