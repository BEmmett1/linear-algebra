\begin{exerciseStatement}


Consider the following two sets of Euclidean vectors: 


\begin{align*}  \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{array}\right] \middle|\,y^{2} - 7 \, z^{2} = x\right\}  & &   \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{array}\right] \middle|\,2 \, x + 7 \, y = 4 \, z\right\}  \\ \end{align*}
            

 Explain why one of these sets is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^ 3 \) and one is not.
