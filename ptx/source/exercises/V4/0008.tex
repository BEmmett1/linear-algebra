\begin{exerciseStatement}


Consider the following two sets of Euclidean vectors: 


\begin{align*}  \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
x \\
y \\
z \\
w
\end{array}\right] \middle|\,4 \, w + 7 \, x = 6 \, y + 2 \, z\right\}  & &   \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
x \\
y \\
z \\
w
\end{array}\right] \middle|\,y^{2} + 2 \, x = 2 \, z\right\}  \\ \end{align*}
            

 Explain why one of these sets is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^ 4 \) and one is not.
