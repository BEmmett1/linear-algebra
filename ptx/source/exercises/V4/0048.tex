\begin{exerciseStatement}


Consider the following two sets of Euclidean vectors: 


\begin{align*}  \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
x \\
y
\end{array}\right] \middle|\,2 \, x + 5 \, y = 0\right\}  & &   \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
x \\
y
\end{array}\right] \middle|\,5 \, x = y^{3}\right\}  \\ \end{align*}
            

 Explain why one of these sets is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^ 2 \) and one is not.
