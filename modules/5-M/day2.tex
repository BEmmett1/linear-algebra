\begin{activity}{5}
Let $A=\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 & -1 \\ 0 & 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.  Find a $3 \times 3$ matrix $I$ such that $IA=A$.
\end{activity}

\begin{definition}
The identity matrix $I_n$ (sometimes written as just $I$ if $n$ is understood) is  the $n \times n$ matrix $$I_n = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  & \hdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots  \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ 0 & \hdots & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
It has a $1$ on each diagonal element and a $0$ in every other position.
\end{definition}

\begin{activity}{15}
Each row operation can be interpreted as a matrix multiplication.  $A=\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 & -1 \\ 0 & 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.


 \begin{subactivity}
 Find a matrix $S_1$ such that $S_1A$ is the result of doubling the fourth row of $A$.
 
 {\em Hint:  Tweak the identity matrix slightly.}
 \end{subactivity}
 \begin{subactivity}
 Find a matrix $S_2$ such that $S_2A$ is the result of adding $5$ times the third row of $A$ to the first.
 \end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
 Find a matrix $S_3$ such that $S_3A$ is the result of swapping the second and third rows of $A$.
 \end{subactivity}


\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
For any matrix $A$, we can find a series of matrices $R_1, \ldots, R_k$ corresponding to the row operations such that $$R_1 R_2 \cdots R_k A = \RREF(A).$$
\end{observation}


\begin{activity}{15}
Let $T: \IR^n \rightarrow \IR^m$ be a linear map with matrix $A$ (for the standard basis).  Consider the following statements about $T$
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $T$ is injective (i.e. one-to-one)
\item $T$ is surjective (i.e. onto)
\item $T$ is bijective (i.e. both injective and surjective)
\item $AX=B$ has a solution for all $m \times 1$ matrices $B$
\item $AX=B$ has a unique solution for all $m \times 1$ matrices $B$
\item $AX=0$ has a non-trivial solution.
\item The columns of $A$ span $\IR^m$
\item The columns of $A$ are linearly independent
\item The columns of $A$ are a basis of $\IR^m$
\item $\RREF(A)$ has $n$ pivot columns
\item $\RREF(A)$ has $m$ pivot columns
\end{enumerate}

Sort these statements into three groups of equivalent statements.
