Find a $4 \times 4$ matrix $I$ such that, for any $4 \times n$ matrix $A$, $IA=A$.
\end{activity}

\begin{definition}
The identity matrix $I_n$ (sometimes written as just $I$ if $n$ is understood) is  the $n \times n$ matrix $$I_n = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  & \hdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots  \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ 0 & \hdots & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{activity}{15}
Each row operation can be interpreted as a matrix multiplication.  Let $A$ be a $4 \times 4$ matrix.
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item Find a matrix $S_1$ such that $S_1A$ is the result of swapping the second and fourth rows of $A$.
\item Find a matrix $S_2$ such that $S_2A$ is the result of adding $5$ times the third row of $A$ to the first.
\item Find a matrix $S_3$ such that $S_3A$ is the result of doubling the fourth row of $A$.
\end{enumerate}

{\em Hint:  Tweak the identity matrix slightly.}

\begin{activity}{15}
Let $T: \IR^n \rightarrow \IR^m$ be a linear map with matrix $A$ (for the standard basis).  Consider the following statements about $T$
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $T$ is injective
\item $T$ is surjective
\item $T$ is bijective (i.e. both injective and surjective)
\item $AX=B$ has a solution for all $m \times 1$ matrices $B$
\item $AX=B$ has a unique solution for all $m \times 1$ matrices $B$
\item $AX=0$ has a non-trivial solution.
\item The columns of $A$ span $\IR^m$
\item The columns of $A$ are linearly independent
\item The columns of $A$ are a basis of $\IR^m$
\item $\RREF(A)$ has $n$ pivot columns
\item $\RREF(A)$ has $m$ pivot columns
\end{enumerate}

Sort these statements into groups of equivalent statements.
