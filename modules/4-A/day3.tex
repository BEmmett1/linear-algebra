\begin{observation}
Let $T: V \rightarrow W$.  Last class we made 4 definitions.
\begin{itemize}
\item  $T$ is called \term{injective} or \term{one-to-one} if $T$ does not map two distinct values to the same place.
\item $T$ is called \term{surjective} if every element of $W$ is mapped to by some element of $V$.
\item The \term{kernel} of $T$ is the set of all things that are mapped to $\vec{0}$.  It is a subspace of $V$.
\item The \term{image} of $T$ is the set of all things in $W$ that are mapped to by something in $V$.  It is a subspace of $W$.
\end{itemize}
\end{observation}

Let $T: \IR^3 \rightarrow \IR^3$ be a linear transformation.  Suppose you know that $\ker T = \{ \vec{0} \}$.  What can you conclude about $T$?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $T$ is injective
\item $T$ is not injective
\item $T$ is surjective
\item $T$ is not surjective
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}

\begin{fact}
This goes both ways.  A linear transformation $T$ is injective {\bf if and only if} $\ker T = \{\vec{0}\}$ (sometimes phrased as ``The kernel of $T$ is \term{trivial}'').

\ \\
If $T(\vec{v})=T(\vec{w})$, then $T(\vec{v}-\vec{w})=0$
\end{fact}

Let $T: \IR^3 \rightarrow \IR^3$ be a linear transformation.  Suppose you know that $\Im T = {\rm span} \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \right\}$.  What can you conclude about $T$?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $T$ is injective
\item $T$ is not injective
\item $T$ is surjective
\item $T$ is not surjective
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}

\begin{fact}
This goes both ways.  A linear transformation $T:V \rightarrow W$ is surjective {\bf if and only if} $\Im T = W$.
\end{fact}

\begin{activity}{15}
Let $T: \IR^n \rightarrow \IR^m$ be a linear map with matrix $A$ (for the standard bases).  You have cards containing a number of statements about $T$ and $A$.  Sort them into two groups of equivalent statements, and post them on your board.
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $T$ is injective
\item $T$ is surjective
\item The system of linear equations given by the augmented matrix $\begin{bmatrix}[c|c]A & \vec{b} \end{bmatrix}$ has a solution for all $\vec{b} \in \IR^m$
\item The system of linear equations given by the augmented matrix~$\begin{bmatrix}[c|c] A & \vec{0} \end{bmatrix}$ has a non-trivial solution.
\item The columns of $A$ span $\IR^m$
\item The columns of $A$ are linearly independent
\item Every column of $\RREF(A)$ is a pivot column
\item $\RREF(A)$ has a non-pivot column \\

\begin{definition}
If $T: \IR^n \rightarrow \IR^m$ is both injective and surjective, it is called \term{bijective}
\end{definition}
