E: How can we solve systems of linear equations?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
E1: I can translate back and forth between a system of linear equations, a vector
equation, and the corresponding augmented matrix.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
E2: I can explain why a matrix isnâ€™t in reduced row echelon form, and put a matrix in
reduced row echelon form
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
E3: I can compute the solution set for a system of linear equations or a vector
equation.
